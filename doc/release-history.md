# Release History

## v2.1.7 (2026-10-10)

The "Internet" button in the status bar is gone. It opened a direct connection from the browser to
the oevsv.at MeshCom map server, which has been switched off upstream, so pressing it only produced
a permanent red "Internet: Connection failed" message. The function is removed without
replacement: McApp shows exactly what your own node and the McApp backend deliver. Schema stays at
35 and `SYSTEM_EPOCH` stays at 5.

### Highlights

- **No more Internet button and no more red "Internet: Connection failed" popup.** The button is
  gone from the desktop status bar and from the mobile status sheet. A browser that had it switched
  on simply forgets the setting.
- **The "Sent — seen on the internet" status is gone with it.** It could only be set by the
  removed feed. Your own messages still show "Sent", "Echo" and the acknowledgements from your node,
  the gateway and the addressee exactly as before.
- **Stations that only the internet feed knew about disappear from the map** at the next start of
  the app. Everything your node or the backend reported stays.

### Backend (MCProxy)

- No functional change. Dependencies refreshed (both `uv.lock` files: httptools 0.9.0, pycparser
  3.11, ruff 0.17.0); fastapi 0.143.0 and pydantic 2.14.0 came in earlier in this cycle.

### Frontend (webapp)

- The browser's WebSocket client for `mcmap.oevsv.at` is deleted, together with its settings key,
  its connection toasts and the offline-banner state "Local proxy unreachable — Internet data live".
- Messages cached in the browser are cleaned up once on load: the old "seen on the internet" flag
  is dropped, and an acknowledgement that only the internet feed had seen is treated like any other
  acknowledgement your browser matched itself. If McApp itself never saw that acknowledgement, the
  ✓✓ on such an old message goes away at the next reconnect.
- vite 8.3.4, vue-router 5.4.0, maplibre-gl 6.13.0 and a transitive refresh.

### Upgrade notes

- Nothing to do on the Pi. Reload the app once (the "Update available" banner) so the browser
  drops the old bundle and the Internet button with it.

## Earlier releases, in brief

One entry per release. The full notes as published are in
[`doc/archive/release-history-full.md`](https://github.com/DK5EN/McApp/blob/development/doc/archive/release-history-full.md).

### v2.1.6 (2026-10-06)

- Remote node administration over LoRa (signed `RM1` messages) in Node Admin > Remote Management;
  nodes and passwords are stored in Settings > Remote nodes. Schema 34 → 35, `SYSTEM_EPOCH` 5.
- New navigation: Node Admin holds BLE and Remote Management; the RF Monitor moved to Settings.

### v2.1.5 (2026-10-05)

- A time-zone rule on the node survives reconnects; a node with an empty rule gets the host's rule
  once (`MCAPP_NODE_TZ_POLICY=never` opts out, `MCAPP_NODE_TZ` overrides it).
- Overheard acknowledgements no longer mark your own message as delivered.

### v2.1.4 (2026-10-04)

- QRZ.com lookups are no longer limited to 50 per day on a paid subscription; free accounts keep
  every limit.

### v2.1.3 (2026-10-04)

- QRZ.com suspensions record why they were set, so a subscriber account recovers after a password
  re-entry; the settings card shows paid or free. Schema 33 → 34 (`qrz_state.suspend_reason`).

### v2.1.2 (2026-10-04)

- QRZ.com's own lookup counter only pauses lookups on free accounts; on a subscriber account it is
  not a daily count and paused every login.

### v2.1.1 (2026-10-04)

- First name and QTH next to callsigns, looked up on QRZ.com with your own account (Settings →
  QRZ.com Lookup). Schema 32 → 33 (`callsign_info`, `qrz_lookups`, `qrz_state`).

### v2.1.0 (2026-10-02)

- Matches node firmware v4.40a: the reading position holds when you scroll up (chat and RF
  Monitor), and a store node's `:sto` notice shows as "held by …" instead of a chat bubble
  (`ack_predicate_vectors.json` v3).

### v2.0.18 (2026-09-29)

- Message details show the right acknowledgements after a firmware message ID is reused, your own
  relayed message is one bubble, and retried direct messages count once on every path.

### v2.0.17 (2026-09-28)

- The Update page shows the release notes ("What's new") before you install, Web Push is sent
  without `pywebpush` (about 16 MB less memory), and the own-message ✓ tells which signal it rests
  on (`msg_www` split into `msg_echo`).

### v2.0.16 (2026-09-28)

- Direct messages that newer firmware resends up to three times count once: one row, one push,
  one bubble, one unread. Dedup contract v2.
- The ACK details list each station once.

### v2.0.15 (2026-09-26)

- New node registers `IS1` and `SN1` (build date, via state), needs firmware upstream `dev` or a
  DK5EN fork build from 2026-09-25 or later.
- The own station on the map no longer shows a relay's signal.

### v2.0.14 (2026-09-24)

- DBG button: the node's debug console inside the RF Monitor, plus colour and icons.
- Link check works without Extern-UDP pointed at McApp, given firmware that forwards the pong
  over BLE. A password-protected console needs `NODE_CONSOLE_PASSWORD` in the config.

### v2.0.13 (2026-09-23)

- RF Monitor: a live, interpreted view of every frame the node hears or sends.
- Your own messages no longer disappear behind your own spam filters.

### v2.0.12 (2026-09-21)

- A firmware message ID repeats roughly every 1000 frames a node sends; a newer broadcast could
  show the ACK of an older, unrelated message that had reused the same ID. Acknowledgements are
  now bound within a 4 h window, and a reused ID no longer swallows the new message's own ACKs.
- A peer ACK that arrives as text shows who sent it.

### v2.0.11 (2026-09-20)

- An unread `+1` that could never be cleared is fixed; a bare link is no longer hidden as an
  advert.
- `@`-mentions raise a push notification, off by default (enable it in the notification
  settings). **Push contract v11.** First start re-classifies stored messages once in the
  background.

### v2.0.10 (2026-09-19)

- Ingest stalls fixed: they were SD-card fsyncs, not slow queries.
- A bootstrap run can no longer take the box off the network (network packages held and pinned).
  **`SYSTEM_EPOCH` 5.**
- Unread badges for digit-less callsigns such as `WLNK-1` clear again (#11); the Safari update
  banner clears.

### v2.0.9 (2026-09-18)

- Hotfix (#10): over plain `http://` the webapp could not send, scan for devices or show two
  cards. Webapp only.

### v2.0.8 (2026-09-16)

- Stall tracking: every slow call between webapp and API is recorded for reproduction.
- Memory on the Pi Zero: the CMA pool shrinks from 256 to 64 MB and MemTotal rises from 415 to
  473 MB; store-and-forward DM states (held, failed) are shown.
- **Schema v32, push contract v10, `SYSTEM_EPOCH` 4. Reboot the Pi once** after this update for
  the memory settings.

### v2.0.7 (2026-09-11)

- Position beacons carry the comment and node name as separate fields.

### v2.0.6 (2026-09-11)

- The Update page activates any deployed slot instead of "rollback", and never touches the
  database (the old rollback could restore a stale copy).
- BLE position frames follow the firmware's key contract: neighbour counts, QNH, telemetry typed.

### v2.0.5 (2026-09-10)

- BLE protocol audit: messages received while BLE was down keep their real time, a second
  transport copy enriches the message instead of being dropped, no phantom notifications after a
  reconnect. **Push contract v9.**

### v2.0.4 (2026-09-06)

- Unread badges are server-side read cursors, the same on every device.
- An ingest race that stored most messages twice is closed. **Schema v30.**

### v2.0.3 (2026-09-06)

- Who acknowledged a message is shown, not just that it was (needs node firmware
  v4.35s.09.06 or later).
- UDP/443 open for HTTP/3. **Schema v29, `SYSTEM_EPOCH` 2.**

### v2.0.2 (2026-09-01)

- Gateway Availability read 0 % while the link was fine; fixed and the spurious gaps removed.
- The blocklist applies to messages already stored; relayed MHeard beacons credit the sender
  (inert since the upstream 2026-08-28 firmware revert of MH `SRC`/`GW`/`PP` — parser retained).
- The dark map needs an API key. **Schema v28.**

### v2.0.1 (2026-08-22)

- Gateway Availability: a measured record of the node's uplink to the MeshCom server.
  **Schema v25.**

### v2.0.0 (2026-08-21)

- Major release, 765 commits since v1.6.13: Link Check, Web Push, hashtag channels, admin module
  with a backend-authoritative blocklist, self-converging deployments. **Schema v17 → v24, push
  contract v7.**
- Building the webapp needs Node 26 or later; the backend stays on Python 3.11 or later.

### v1.6.13 (2026-06-20)

- Maintenance release: high-frequency UDP/ACK log lines demoted from INFO to DEBUG, dependency
  updates only. No functional changes.
