# Release History

## v1.6.13 (2026-06-20)

Maintenance release: reduces journal log noise and rolls up dependency updates. No functional changes.

### Backend (MCProxy)

- **[perf]** High-frequency INFO log lines for UDP telemetry, ACK receipt, and UDP send are demoted to DEBUG. All three are confirmed to land in the database (`telemetry` table, `messages.send_success`, and echo-back ingest respectively), so logging them at INFO produced constant journald noise with no diagnostic value. Error and warning paths are untouched.
- **[chore]** `uv lock --upgrade` dependency sweeps.

### Frontend (webapp)

- **[chore]** `npm update` — minor and patch dependency bumps (vue, vue-tsc, vite-plugin-vue, typescript-eslint, transitive patches).
