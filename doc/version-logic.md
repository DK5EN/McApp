# McApp Version Logic

Reference document for version numbering and release workflow.

## 1. Version Format

| Channel             | Format                     | Example        | Where Used                               |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Stable (production) | `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`       | `v1.4.0`       | `main` branch, GitHub release            |
| Dev (pre-release)   | `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-dev.N` | `v1.4.1-dev.3` | `development` branch, GitHub pre-release |

- `pyproject.toml` always contains the **next target version** (bare, no `v` prefix): e.g., `version = "1.4.1"`
- Git tags carry the `v` prefix: `v1.4.0`, `v1.4.1-dev.1`
- Runtime version (`__init__.py`) uses `git describe --tags` which returns the tag if on one, or `v1.4.1-dev.1-3-gabcdef` if commits exist after the last tag

### Key Principles

1. **Always start on `development`** — the script refuses to run from any other branch.
2. **`pyproject.toml` is the single source of truth** — the production release reads the version as-is, never computes a new one.
3. **Release notes are authored on `development`** — committed there, then arrive on `main` via merge. No direct commits to `main`.
4. **Both repos are managed together** — MCProxy and webapp get identical tags and branch switches.
5. **Post-release prep is automatic** — after a production release, the script bumps to the next patch version and pushes.

## 3. Concrete Examples

### Patch Cycle: v1.4.0 → v1.4.1

| Step | Branch        | Action                                         | `pyproject.toml` | Git Tags (both repos)        | GitHub Release                   |
| ---- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1    | `main`        | v1.4.0 just released                           | `1.4.0`          | `v1.4.0` in McApp + webapp   | McApp v1.4.0                     |
| 2    | `development` | Post-release prep: bump to next patch          | **`1.4.1`**      | —                            | —                                |
| 3    | `development` | Dev work, run `release.sh`                     | `1.4.1`          | `v1.4.1-dev.1` in both repos | McApp v1.4.1-dev.1 (pre-release) |
| 4    | `development` | More work, run `release.sh` again              | `1.4.1`          | `v1.4.1-dev.2` in both repos | McApp v1.4.1-dev.2 (pre-release) |
| 5    | `development` | Run `release.sh`, choose Production            | `1.4.1`          | **`v1.4.1`** in both repos   | McApp v1.4.1                     |
| 6    | `development` | Post-release prep (automatic): bump to `1.4.2` | **`1.4.2`**      | —                            | —                                |

### Minor Cycle: v1.4.1 → v1.5.0

| Step | Branch        | Action                                         | `pyproject.toml` | Git Tags (both repos)        | GitHub Release                   |
| ---- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1    | `main`        | v1.4.1 just released                           | `1.4.1`          | `v1.4.1` in McApp + webapp   | McApp v1.4.1                     |
| 2    | `development` | Post-release prep: bump to next minor          | **`1.5.0`**      | —                            | —                                |
| 3    | `development` | Dev work, run `release.sh`                     | `1.5.0`          | `v1.5.0-dev.1` in both repos | McApp v1.5.0-dev.1 (pre-release) |
| 4    | `development` | More work, run `release.sh` again              | `1.5.0`          | `v1.5.0-dev.2` in both repos | McApp v1.5.0-dev.2 (pre-release) |
| 5    | `development` | Run `release.sh`, choose Production            | `1.5.0`          | **`v1.5.0`** in both repos   | McApp v1.5.0                     |
| 6    | `development` | Post-release prep (automatic): bump to `1.5.1` | **`1.5.1`**      | —                            | —                                |

The **developer chooses** patch vs minor at step 2, when setting `pyproject.toml` after a release. The automatic post-release prep always bumps patch; for a minor bump, manually edit `pyproject.toml` before the next dev cycle.

## 4. Webapp Version Check Bug

### Current Implementation

The webapp (`useVersionCheck.ts`) fetches the 20 most recent GitHub releases and finds:

- `latestStable`: first non-prerelease tag
- `latestPrerelease`: first prerelease tag

Then computes:

```typescript
const hasUpdate = computed(
  () => hasStableUpdate.value || hasPrereleaseUpdate.value,
);
```

### The Bug

This OR logic means a **stable** user gets alerted about dev pre-releases, and a **dev** user gets alerted about stable releases from a different version line.

**Example**: User is on `v1.4.0` (stable). A `v1.5.0-dev.1` pre-release appears. `hasPrereleaseUpdate` becomes true → user sees "update available" even though they're on the stable channel.

### Correct Logic

| Installed Version    | Alert When                                                 |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Stable (`v1.4.0`)    | Newer **stable** release exists (e.g., `v1.4.1`, `v1.5.0`) |
| Dev (`v1.4.1-dev.2`) | Newer **dev pre-release** exists (e.g., `v1.4.1-dev.3`)    |

```typescript
// Correct
const hasUpdate = computed(() => {
  const v = parseVersion(local.value);
  if (!v) return false;
  return v.isDev ? hasPrereleaseUpdate.value : hasStableUpdate.value;
});
```

## 5. Release Script Workflow

### Overview

`release.sh` is always run from the `development` branch. It presents an interactive menu:

```
  McApp Release Builder
  =====================

==> Mode: dev/production
==> Version in pyproject.toml: 1.4.1

  What type of release?

    1) Dev pre-release  (tag development, publish pre-release)
    2) Production       (merge to main, tag, publish stable release)

  Choose [1/2]:
```

Both repos (MCProxy and webapp) must be on `development` and have clean working trees before the script will proceed.

### Production Release Steps

Starting from `development` in both repos:

```
 1. Validate: both repos on development, both clean
 2. Read version from pyproject.toml (e.g., "1.4.1")
 3. Find previous prod tag (e.g., v1.4.0)
 4. Verify tag v1.4.1 doesn't already exist in either repo
 5. Verify main has no commits ahead of development (no divergence)
 6. Print Claude prompt for release notes: new "## v1.4.1 (date)" section at the top of
    doc/release-history.md; condense the previous top section into a brief entry under
    "## Earlier releases, in brief"; prepend that previous section's published text, unchanged,
    to doc/archive/release-history-full.md
 7. Wait for user to press Enter
 8. validate_release_notes_top: the first "## " heading must be "## v1.4.1" and its section
    non-empty, else abort before any commit/merge/tag
 9. Commit release-history.md AND archive/release-history-full.md on development (if dirty)
10. Checkout main in both repos
11. Merge development → main (--no-ff) in both repos
12. Build webapp
13. Build tarball
14. Tag v1.4.1 (annotated) in both repos
15. Push main + tags for both repos
16. Generate checksum
17. Upload GitHub release: only the "## v1.4.1" section (heading excluded, up to the next "## "),
    plus a footer line linking back to doc/release-history.md — not the whole file
18. Checkout development in both repos
19. Bump pyproject.toml to 1.4.2 (next patch) plus the local-package version lines in uv.lock and
    ble_service/uv.lock, commit, push
20. Done
```

### Dev Pre-Release Steps

Stays on `development`:

```
1. Validate: both repos on development, both clean
2. Read version from pyproject.toml (e.g., "1.4.1")
3. Find highest existing v1.4.1-dev.N tag, compute N+1
4. Build webapp
5. Tag v1.4.1-dev.{N+1} (lightweight) in both repos
6. Build tarball
7. Generate checksum
8. Upload GitHub pre-release (also pushes McApp tag)
9. Push webapp tag
10. Cleanup artifacts
```

No `pyproject.toml` modification needed for dev releases.

### Dual-Repo Management

Both repos (`MCProxy/` and `../webapp/`) receive **identical tags** at every release step. The webapp repo is a separate Git repository with its own history, but shares the same version tags as McApp.

```bash
# release.sh tags both repos
WEBAPP_DIR="$(cd "$PROJECT_DIR/../webapp" && pwd)"

# For production (annotated tags)
git -C "$PROJECT_DIR" tag -a "$version" -m "Release ${version}"
git -C "$WEBAPP_DIR"  tag -a "$version" -m "Release ${version}"

# For dev (lightweight tags)
git -C "$PROJECT_DIR" tag "$version"
git -C "$WEBAPP_DIR"  tag "$version"

# Push tags for both
git -C "$PROJECT_DIR" push origin "$version"
git -C "$WEBAPP_DIR"  push origin "$version"
```

### Release Notes Generation

Before a production release, the script prints a prompt with commits from both repos since the
last production tag, asking for a new top section in `doc/release-history.md`, a condensed brief
entry for the previous top release, and that previous section prepended verbatim to
`doc/archive/release-history-full.md`. The user runs this prompt with Claude, then presses Enter to
continue. `validate_release_notes_top` immediately checks that the first `## ` heading is
`## vX.Y.Z` and non-empty, aborting before anything is committed if not. Both files are then
committed together on `development` before the merge to `main`, so they arrive on `main` naturally.

```bash
# The script prints something like:
#   Summarize the changes since v1.4.0 for a GitHub release of v1.4.1.
#   Backend commits (MCProxy):
#     a6c22ad [docs] Add release history
#     b5ae31f [fix] Parse negative temperatures
#   Frontend commits (webapp):
#     f3a1b2c [feat] Add dark mode toggle
#     d4e5f6a [fix] Fix mobile layout
#   Add a new "## v1.4.1 (date)" section at the top of doc/release-history.md.
#   Condense the previous top section into a brief entry under
#   "## Earlier releases, in brief", and prepend its full section, unchanged,
#   to doc/archive/release-history-full.md.
```

### Failure Recovery

The `on_failure()` trap handler:

- Removes local artifacts (tarball, checksum, staging dir)
- Deletes GitHub release if created
- Deletes tags from **both repos** (local and remote)
- Restores **both repos** to `development` if switched to `main`
- Aborts in-progress merges

### What the Script Does NOT Do

- Compute or auto-bump the version (reads `pyproject.toml` as-is)
- Modify `pyproject.toml` on `main` (the merge from `development` brought the right version)
- Allow release without clean working trees in both repos
- Allow release from any branch other than `development`
- Tag only one repo — both repos are always tagged together
- Publish more than the newest release's top section as the GitHub release body — older sections
  live on in `doc/release-history.md`'s brief list and in the archive file, never in a release body

## 6. Piped Install Pinning (Bootstrap Install-Ref Resolution)

A piped install (`curl … | sudo bash`, `bootstrap/mcapp.sh`) resolves one
release ref before it sources any bootstrap library, and pins the whole run
to it: bootstrap libs, templates, and the app all come from the same tag.
The same command run again later, on the same tag, produces the same box.
Design rationale and the bug this closes:
[`2026-08-09_1600-bootstrap-tag-pinning-plan.md`](2026-08-09_1600-bootstrap-tag-pinning-plan.md).

### Resolving the ref

`resolve_install_ref()` in `bootstrap/mcapp.sh` sets two values before
`source_libs()` runs — `MCAPP_INSTALL_REF` (what the bootstrap tree, i.e.
libs + templates, is fetched from) and `MCAPP_INSTALL_APP_VERSION` (what
`deploy_app()` installs):

| Flag / env                          | App version                                                               | Bootstrap tree ref                                                  | API calls                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `--tag TAG`                         | `TAG`                                                                     | `TAG` (unless `--ref` overrides it)                                 | 0                                  |
| `--dev`                             | highest `-dev.N` tag (`GET /releases?per_page=100`, parsed without `jq`)  | same tag                                                            | 1                                  |
| default                             | latest stable tag (`GET /releases/latest`)                                | same tag                                                            | 1                                  |
| `--ref REF` / `MCAPP_BOOTSTRAP_REF` | still resolved by the rules above — `--ref` never affects the app version | forced to `REF` (any branch or tag), independent of the app version | as above (0 combined with `--tag`) |

The ref is resolved exactly once and exported, so a release cut mid-run
cannot land libs on one tag and the app on another. `--ref` is for
developing bootstrap changes without cutting a release, and doubles as a
one-line field rollback: `--ref development` reproduces the pre-pinning
branch-tip behavior for libs and templates.

The bootstrap tree itself is fetched as one tarball (`fetch_bootstrap_tree()`
in `mcapp.sh`) — the checksummed release asset
(`mcapp-<ref>.tar.gz`/`.sha256`) when the ref is a tag, falling back to an
unverified codeload archive (warned) for a tag without assets or for a
branch ref. Raw-URL fallbacks used by the sourced libs (template lookups,
the legacy webapp download) are rebased on the resolved ref too, so even
that cold path stays pinned.

### When the GitHub API is unreachable

| Situation                                                            | App version                                                     | Bootstrap tree ref                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--tag` given                                                        | not affected — `--tag` never calls the API                      |                                                                      |
| Fresh install (no `/etc/mcapp/config.json`), API unreachable         | **aborts**, printing a copy-paste `--tag <version>` retry hint  | n/a — the run exits before `source_libs()`                           |
| Existing install (repair / `--skip` / `--converge`), API unreachable | left `"unknown"` — `deploy_app()` leaves the current slot as-is | **warns loudly**, falls back to `main` (`development` under `--dev`) |

A fresh install has nothing to salvage if it cannot name a version, so it
refuses to silently become "whatever a branch tip happens to be today." An
existing install is the one case where finishing beats staying pinned, and
it is the case where an operator is watching the output.

### Script/lib skew guard

After sourcing whatever bootstrap tree was resolved, `mcapp.sh` verifies
(`declare -F`, against `REQUIRED_LIB_FUNCTIONS`) that the libs actually
define every function the running script's `main()` calls. A tag old enough
to predate one of those functions — e.g. `ensure_web_frontend` or
`caddy_config_marker`, added with Caddy/system-epoch support — aborts
cleanly instead of running with a mismatched pair:

```
ERROR: v1.5.1's bootstrap libs do not provide: ensure_web_frontend caddy_config_marker
       Run that release's own installer instead:
       curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DK5EN/McApp/v1.5.1/bootstrap/mcapp.sh \
         | sudo bash -s -- --tag v1.5.1
```

That suggested remedy assumes the target tag's own `mcapp.sh` already has
this pinning fix. For a tag old enough to predate the fix itself (e.g.
`v1.6.13`), the tag's own script still has the original bug — it pulls
bootstrap libs from the `development` branch tip unconditionally — so piping
from it does not reproduce that tag's historical libs either. Reproducing a
pre-fix tag's exact original state still requires installing from that tag's
own tree non-piped (fetch its tarball/codeload archive, run
`bootstrap/mcapp.sh` locally). `doc/update-converge.md` (Step 1) is a worked
example for `v1.6.13`.
