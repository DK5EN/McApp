# ADR: Link Check (firmware `{ping}` / `{pong}`) in McApp

**Date:** 2026-08-13
**Status:** **Implemented and deployed** 2026-08-14 in `v1.6.14-dev.35` (`mcapp.local`). Protocol validated on air (§1.5); the deployed stack re-verified end to end after release (§6). **Amended 2026-09-25** (§9): two firmware limitations this ADR treated as permanent — no BLE pong (§1.4 point 4) and unbounded ping retransmission (§1.4 point 7) — are now fixed in the DK5EN fork; official firmware and upstream are unchanged.
**Affects:** `storage/ingest.py`, `commands/linkcheck.py` (new), `sse_routes/linkcheck.py` (new), `main.py`, frontend `webapp`
**Implementation plan:** `doc/archive/2026-08-13_1500-linkcheck-implementation-plan.md`
**Review:** `doc/archive/2026-08-13_1500-linkcheck-verdict.md` — this ADR's first draft contained two
design-breaking protocol errors; both are corrected here and recorded there.

## 1. Context

MeshCom firmware `v4.35p.07.24.2` added a "PING check": a node can probe whether another node is
reachable **on direct RF**, and the operator gets sequence number, round-trip time and signal
quality on the node's own display.

The published article documents only the console commands. It does not document the wire format,
does not say the exchange is a plain DM, and does not mention that the result never reaches a
connected phone. Everything below was read out of the firmware source in
`/Users/martinwerner/WebDev/MeshCom-Firmware-DEV-Main` (branch `v4.35p_prio`).

**Scope of the upstream comparison:** the ping/pong logic and payload strings match
`upstream/oe1kbc_v4.35p` HEAD (`3e8ffccc`), and the four upstream commits we are behind touch GPS,
track mode and `--setlog` only. The **files** are not identical — `loop_functions.cpp`,
`lora_functions.cpp`, `extudp_functions.cpp` and `command_functions.cpp` differ from upstream by
26/42/20/5 added lines respectively. All line numbers below are **local**.

### 1.1 Console commands (node-local)

| Command             | Effect                                                  | Source                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `--pingcall <call>` | target callsign; empty clears, non-empty arms the timer | `command_functions.cpp:3300` |
| `--pingtime <s>`    | repeat interval; `<15` or `>300` is coerced to 60       | `command_functions.cpp:3340` |
| `--pingmax <n>`     | max attempts, `1..5`; out of range coerced to 5         | `command_functions.cpp:3384` |
| `--pingmax max`     | sets 100                                                | `command_functions.cpp:3375` |
| `--ping start`      | `node_pingcount = node_pingmax`                         | `command_functions.cpp:3363` |
| `--ping stop`       | `node_pingcount = 0`                                    | `command_functions.cpp:3370` |

`PING_INTERVAL = 60`, `PING_MAX = 5` (`configuration_global.h:72-73`).

Two deviations from the article, both confirmed in source:

- The article gives the `--pingtime` range as 30-300. The setter accepts 15-300, but the scheduler
  only fires at `node_pingtime > 29` (`esp32_main.cpp:3707`). **Values 15..29 are accepted and then
  silently ignored.**
- `--pingmax max` yields 100, not 99.

### 1.2 Wire format

There is no new packet type. Both directions are ordinary `MSG_TYPE_TEXT` DMs with a magic
payload:

| Direction                | Payload on air          | Built at                  |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Ping, node's own timer   | `{ping}`                | `loop_functions.cpp:3103` |
| Ping, sent through McApp | `{ping}{NNN`            | `loop_functions.cpp:3395` |
| Pong                     | `{pong}{<ping_msg_id>}` | `loop_functions.cpp:3184` |

**The ACK suffix has no closing brace.** `sendMessage()` appends `"{" + %03i` to every DM
(`loop_functions.cpp:3395`), so a ping we originate is `{ping}{042` on the wire. All matching must
be prefix-based; an equality test against `"{ping}"` fails.

### 1.3 The correlation token — two representations, neither obvious

This is where the first draft of this ADR was wrong, twice. Both errors would have produced a
feature that silently never correlates.

**(a) The Extern-UDP `msg_id` field is hex; the pong payload is decimal.**
`extudp_functions.cpp:365` formats it as `snprintf(_msgId, sizeof(_msgId), "%08X", …)` and assigns
it at `:505`, so every Extern-UDP frame carries an **8-digit uppercase hex string**
(`"1AE1E057"`, a real capture). The pong embeds the same 32-bit value in **decimal**. McApp already reflects this
elsewhere — `messages.msg_id` is `TEXT` (`migrations.py:557`).

**(b) About half of all nodes emit a negative pong id.** `SendPong(String, unsigned int msg_id)`
(`loop_functions.h:63`) is formatted with the **signed** `%i` (`loop_functions.cpp:3184`). The id
is `((_GW_ID & 0x3FFFFF) << 10) | (node_msgid & 0x3FF)`, occupying bits 10-31, so bit 31 is set
whenever bit 21 of `_GW_ID` is — deterministic per node, roughly half the fleet. Those nodes send
`{pong}{-1234567890}`.

The firmware contradicts itself on this: the ping display reads `cmsg[7..9]`
(`loop_functions.cpp:3138`) while the pong display reads `substring(14,17)` (`:2095`) — the two
disagree once the id is 11 characters.

**Consequence for us:** normalise both sides to unsigned 32-bit before comparing.

```
int(echo_msg_id_hex, 16) & 0xFFFFFFFF  ==  pong_decimal & 0xFFFFFFFF
```

Python's `&` on a negative int yields the two's-complement value, so this is exact for both signs.

### 1.4 Behaviour that matters for us

1. **Nearly every node is a responder — but not all.** `lora_functions.cpp:756` answers any
   `{ping}` addressed to our callsign with `SendPong()`. There is no configuration for it, but
   there **is** an opt-out: `SendPong()` early-returns when `bDisplayTrack` is set
   (`loop_functions.cpp:3163-3165`), a one-button toggle (`onebutton_functions.cpp:219`). A node in
   track mode never answers — and those are exactly the mobile stations a link test is most
   interesting for.
2. **RF-direct by design, but NOT in the current fleet.** Foreign ping/pong set
   `bMeshDestination = false` and `bSendAckGateway = false` (`lora_functions.cpp:883/889`), and
   `:1137` additionally suppresses meshing for a `{ping}` to the telemetry group `100001`. Nothing
   reaches the MeshCom server, and group, `*` and `100001` destinations are never answered.

   **Contradicted on air (§1.5.3):** all seven historical pongs in our database arrived with
   `hops=1` — relayed one hop before reaching us. A node running this build will not relay a pong,
   so the relays doing it must run a pre-ping build. The feature is three weeks old and the fleet
   updates slowly, so **assume pongs propagate multi-hop for the foreseeable future.**

   Consequence for the design: a pong's `rssi`/`snr` describes **the last hop**, not the pinged
   station. Signal may only be attributed to the target when the pong arrives with an empty path.
   A pong with a via-path proves reachability but says nothing about the target's signal.

   **Corrected 2026-09-25:** "Nothing reaches the MeshCom server" is wrong. A gateway uploads
   every received text frame that lacks the server flag, including a ping or pong addressed to
   itself — `if(bGATEWAY && (!aprsmsg.msg_server || ...)) addNodeData(...)` in `OnRxDone()`
   (`lora_functions.cpp`), before the relay decision this point describes. Confirmed on air:
   DK5EN-98's console logged `TX-UDP` for an incoming pong (2026-09-24 22:42:46), and DK5EN-1
   (gateway) logged `GWU x1AE1E22C` for an incoming ping (2026-09-25 07:56:48). What the original
   claim gets right is narrower: a foreign ping/pong is not relayed on RF
   (`bMeshDestination = false`) and gets no gateway ACK (`bSendAckGateway = false`). Neither flag
   gates the server upload, which is the frame's ordinary gateway path and fires regardless.

3. **`queueExtern()` runs before any ping/pong filtering.** `lora_functions.cpp:701` queues
   received frames to Extern-UDP, behind three gates: `bEXTUDP`, `is_new_packet()`, and a
   TEXT/POS/HEY type check. Ping and pong therefore arrive at McApp as ordinary `type:"msg"`
   frames carrying `src`, `dst`, `msg_id`, `firmware`, **`rssi` and `snr`**.
4. **The phone never sees a pong.** The `{pong}` branch at `lora_functions.cpp:773` calls
   `queueDisplayText()` and clears `bPingSend`, but never `addBLEOutBuffer()`. On BLE the exchange
   is invisible; it exists only on the OLED.

   **Fixed in the fork firmware (2026-09-24):** the `{pong}` branch of the DM-to-self handler in
   `OnRxDone()` (`src/lora_functions.cpp`) now calls `addBLEOutBuffer(RcvBuffer, size)` like every
   other DM to the node; the raw frame reaches BLE as `{pong}{<id>}` with the server flag intact.
   Commits: `feature-neighbour-matrix` `14a669cf`, `fork-neo-test` `3b018f03`, `fork-main`
   `0e271c17`. Live on DK5EN-98 and DK5EN-1 since 2026-09-24 ~23:26 (OTA to build
   `Sep 24 2026 / 23:15:22`). Official firmware and upstream `dev` are unchanged — see §9.

5. **A ping we originate is echoed back to us with its `msg_id`.** The Extern-UDP inbound handler
   (`extudp_functions.cpp:282`) wraps the payload as `:{dst}payload` and calls `sendMessage()`,
   which echoes to Extern-UDP as `src_type:"node"` (`loop_functions.cpp:3502`). The echo is a
   **synchronous** call that completes before the frame is queued for TX, so the echo always
   precedes the pong — this is a property of the single-threaded main loop, not a protocol
   guarantee, but there is no reordering path.
6. **The node's own timer-driven ping is _not_ echoed.** Neither `sendPing()` nor `SendPong()`
   calls `sendExtern()`. We cannot observe pings the node sends on its own `--pingcall` timer, nor
   our own automatic pong replies.
7. **A ping we originate is retransmitted three further times.** `sendMessage()` arms
   retransmission for any text DM whose payload does not start with `{CET}`, `{MCP}` or `{SET}`
   (`loop_functions.cpp:3466-3472`); `{ping}` is not in that list. Retransmission is cancelled by a
   DM-ACK, and a responder answers with a pong, never an ACK — so nothing cancels it. The schedule
   is fixed at **40 s per retry, `MAX_RETRANSMIT 3`** (`lora_functions.cpp:1911/1932`), so one
   attempt costs **up to four keyings over two minutes**. The node's own `sendPing()` sets `0xFF`
   (no retransmission) and does not do this; only our path does. This block is local-fork code and
   may differ upstream.

   **Corrected by measurement (§1.5.2):** the first draft said this "can elicit up to four pongs
   sharing one correlation id". It does not — three live exchanges produced **exactly one pong
   each**. Retransmissions reuse the same `msg_id`, so the responder's `is_new_packet()` duplicate
   filter drops them. The airtime cost is real; the duplicate-pong problem is not.

   **This is worth a one-line firmware fix in our own fork:** adding `{ping}` to the
   `{CET}`/`{MCP}`/`{SET}` exclusion list at `loop_functions.cpp:3468` would make a proxy-originated
   ping behave like the node's own — one keying instead of four, and no 40 s quantisation in the
   measured time.

   **Fixed in the fork firmware (feature-neighbour-matrix, fork-neo-test; fork-main in progress):**
   a ping sent through `sendMessage()` (BLE, Extern-UDP, web) is now keyed once. The fix keeps the
   ping at personal-DM priority — the TX ring decides priority from the status byte at enqueue, so
   marking it "no retry" up front would have mis-ranked it as a relay. Commits:
   `feature-neighbour-matrix` `df0ea8c1`, `fork-neo-test` `1a14bef5`; `fork-main` has this in
   progress together with the Stage-0 interaction in §9. This measurement's own MAX_RETRANSMIT
   reading holds up under closer count: on 2026-09-24, before the fix, DK5EN-1 received ping
   `x1AE1E1EA` four times (22:42:41, 22:43:26, 22:44:06, 22:44:49 — original + 3 retries); the
   McApp DBG console at the time had only caught two of the three retries.

8. **We cannot ping ourselves.** `sendMessage()` hard-refuses a DM to our own callsign
   (`loop_functions.cpp:3366-3372`, `[ERROR]...DM to own-all not allowed`). A self-test produces no
   transmission at all.

## 1.5 Measured on air, 2026-08-14

Three pings sent from `DK5EN-98` to `DL2JA-2` by writing
`{"type":"msg","dst":"DL2JA-2","msg":"{ping}"}` to the node's Extern-UDP port 1799. All three
answered. This section replaces guesswork with capture; where it contradicts §1.1-§1.4, it wins.

| #   | echo `msg_id` | as decimal  | pong token  | match | echo→pong | RSSI / SNR |
| --- | ------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----- | --------- | ---------- |
| 1   | `1AE1E057`    | 451 010 647 | 451 010 647 | yes   | 23.8 s    | −117 / −4  |
| 2   | `1AE1E059`    | 451 010 649 | 451 010 649 | yes   | 42.6 s    | −127 / −19 |
| 3   | `1AE1E05A`    | 451 010 650 | 451 010 650 | yes   | 29.3 s    | −119 / −9  |

Real frames (run 1), verbatim from `messages`:

```
src=DK5EN-98  dst=DL2JA-2   src_type=node  msg_id=1AE1E057  rssi=0     snr=0.0   msg='{ping}{087'
src=DL2JA-2   dst=DK5EN-98  src_type=lora  msg_id=E9FB720A  rssi=-117  snr=-7.0  msg='{pong}{451010647}'
```

### 1.5.1 Confirmed exactly as designed

- **The hex/decimal split (§1.3a).** `int("1AE1E057", 16) == 451010647`, the pong's token, on all
  three runs. The correlation scheme works.
- **The unterminated ACK suffix (§1.2).** On air the ping reads `{ping}{087`, `{ping}{089`,
  `{ping}{090` — no closing brace, exactly as predicted. Prefix matching is mandatory.
- **The `0/0` sentinel** on `src_type:"node"`; real signal only on `src_type:"lora"`.
- **Echo always precedes pong** (§1.4 point 5), all three runs.
- **Negative pong ids are real (§1.3b).** Not in our own runs, but all seven historical pongs in
  the database (DB0HOB-12 → DK1TCP-77) carry them: `{pong}{-427408969}`, `{pong}{-427409018}`, …
  A `\d+` pattern would have silently failed against that station forever.

### 1.5.2 One pong per ping

No duplicates in any run, over a 150 s and two 80 s observation windows. See §1.4 point 7.

### 1.5.3 Pongs are being relayed

All seven historical pongs arrived `hops=1`. See §1.4 point 2 — this changes what `rssi` means.

### 1.5.4 The measured time is not a round-trip time

23.8 s, 42.6 s, 29.3 s — an order of magnitude too slow for LoRa propagation, and too variable to
be a link metric. Two causes, both structural:

- **The echo timestamps queueing, not transmission.** `sendMessage()` calls `sendExtern()` when it
  puts the frame in the ring buffer, not when the radio keys. On a busy relay node the gap is
  seconds to tens of seconds, and both ends queue.
- **Retransmission quantises it to 40 s steps.** Run 2 at 42.6 s is almost certainly the first
  retransmit (+40 s) being answered ~2.6 s later.

**Design consequence — this is the finding that changes the feature.** McApp cannot measure a
round-trip time this way, and must not display one. What this exchange genuinely delivers is:

1. **reachability** — did the station answer at all, and
2. **RSSI/SNR of the reply**, when the pong arrives with an empty path (§1.4 point 2).

Label the time "response time (includes queueing)" or omit it. Calling it RTT would be wrong by a
factor of ten, and users would compare the numbers between stations as if they meant something.
The node's own OLED `D: x.xxx s` is not affected by the retransmit half of this, since
`sendPing()` does not retransmit — but it still measures from queueing.

### 1.5.6 Path ordering — how `hops` is read

`src` on an Extern-UDP frame is `msg_source_path` (`extudp_functions.cpp:502`). On relay the
firmware builds it as originator-first with each relay appended
(`lora_functions.cpp:1193-1201`: `msg_source_path = msg_source_call + "," + node_call`, then
`concat(',' + node_call)` for each further hop).

So for `src = "DB0HOB-12,DB0ED-99"`: **DB0HOB-12 originated**, DB0ED-99 relayed, and **DB0ED-99 is
the station we actually heard on RF**. Our own DL2JA-2 pongs carried a bare `src = "DL2JA-2"` with
no comma — direct, which is why their RSSI is attributable.

Practical rule for the implementation: `hops = src.count(",")`, and signal is attributable to
`src` only when `hops == 0`. This is the fact §1.4 point 2's gate rests on.

### 1.5.5 Nothing we send survives the round trip

`getExtern()` reads **only** `dst` and `msg` from the inbound JSON
(`extudp_functions.cpp:260-261`); `src_type:"node"` on the echo is set by the firmware. Any tag we
add to the outbound datagram is discarded. Correlating our own echo therefore cannot rely on a
marker we control — only on `dst` + payload prefix + timing.

This answers implementation-plan open question 2 with a **no**, and it is load-bearing for the
echo-claim ambiguity in that plan's §3.2.

---

## 2. Problem

**(a) There is a small bug today.** Point 3 means a `{ping}`/`{pong}` exchange between two _other_
stations within our RF range is already ingested and stored, and shows up in the webapp as garbage
chat (`{pong}{1234567890}` from OE1XYZ-12 to OE3ABC-7). This is live now on every box with
Extern-UDP enabled, without anyone having asked for the feature.

**(b) There is a real feature available to us that the official app cannot have.** Points 3, 5 and
6 together mean McApp can run the whole exchange itself over Extern-UDP — transmit the ping, learn
its `msg_id` from the echo, match the pong, and report RTT plus the signal quality of the reply.
The node-side `--pingcall` mechanism is not needed and would not help.

---

## 3. Decision

Implement link check as an **McApp-driven** feature over Extern-UDP, in four stages, and explicitly
reject the node-side control path.

### 3.1 Stage 0 — drop ping/pong at the ingest filter

Hard-drop `{ping}`/`{pong}` payloads in `storage/ingest.py`'s `_should_filter_message()`
(`:1463`), exactly as `{CET}` is dropped there today (`:1469`). One function, one file, one repo.

Rejected alternative: classifier rules. The first draft proposed that, which would have meant
editing the mc-chat subtree, splitting, pulling, bumping `classifier_ver`, backfilling and
re-running a parity corpus across two repos — to categorise frames that are protocol, not chat.
`_should_filter_message` is where this codebase already puts firmware magic payloads. Dropping
rather than tagging also removes the disk-growth vector in §4.2 entirely.

Filtering suppresses **persistence only**; the router still publishes the frame, which is what
Stage 2 subscribes to.

### 3.2 Stage 1 — feed pong signal into the existing signal architecture

A pong's `rssi`/`snr` is precisely the "signal at which we heard station X" measurement that
`signal_log` already models, including the `source TEXT` column added for exactly this kind of
distinction (`migrations.py:322-325`, values `'mheard'`/`'lora'`). Record link-check replies there
with `source='linkcheck'`.

**No new table and no schema migration.** `doc/UDP-2.0-impl.md`'s own principle — "generalize,
don't fork; the same physical measurement must feed the same tables" — applies directly. A separate
`link_checks` table, as first drafted, would also have been invisible to the existing map and
mHeard views.

The first draft justified that table as "storage Stage 2 needs anyway". It does not: Stage 2's
correlation state is in-memory.

### 3.3 Stage 2 — active ping from McApp

A new `CommandHandler` mixin alongside `commands/ctcping.py`, reusing its session machinery rather
than reimplementing it. `POST /api/linkcheck` starts a session; the ping goes out via
`message_router.publish(...)`; the `src_type:"node"` echo supplies the `msg_id`; the inbound pong
is matched per §1.3; results stream over SSE.

`CTCPingMixin` already provides the shape — `ActivePing`/`PingTest`, a `PingStatus` state machine,
a session registry, an injectable `ping_timeout`, tracked background tasks, repeat caps, callsign
and blocklist validation — including fixes for races that already bit once in production. Building
a second registry from scratch was the first draft's plan and is rejected.

### 3.4 Stage 3 — webapp UI

"Link check" action per station, live result strip, and a view of link-check signal history. Lands
in the separate `webapp` repo.

### 3.5 Rejected — remote control of the node's own ping mode

Driving `--pingcall` / `--ping start` from McApp is rejected. The Extern-UDP inbound path only
emits LoRa DMs (`extudp_functions.cpp:282` hardcodes `:{dst}payload`); it cannot carry console
commands. Even over BLE, where commands could be sent, the results would be unreachable: §1.4
point 4 (no pong to the phone) and point 6 (no Extern-UDP echo of timer-driven pings). Stage 2
delivers strictly more for less.

---

## 4. Consequences

### 4.1 Positive

- **Verified working end to end on air** (§1.5): 3/3 pings answered and correlated, against a
  marginal −117…−127 dBm link, with the firmware already deployed on both ends.
- The responder side needs no configuration.
- We get RSSI/SNR of the reply, a better link metric than "message delivered".
- Removes existing chat noise (§2a) as a side effect of Stage 0.
- Reuses two existing subsystems (`_should_filter_message`, `signal_log`) and one existing session
  engine (`CTCPingMixin`) instead of adding a table, a migration and a parallel registry.

### 4.2 Negative / accepted limitations

- **No usable round-trip time** (§1.5.4). Measured 23.8-42.6 s, dominated by TX queueing and
  40 s retransmit quantisation. The feature delivers reachability and reply signal, not latency.
  Do not display a number labelled RTT.
- **Four keyings per attempt, not one** (§1.4 point 7). Airtime caps must be set against the real
  multiplier. A one-line firmware change in our fork would remove this.

  **Corrected 2026-09-25:** fixed in two of the three fork branches (§1.4 point 7); `fork-main` in
  progress. Official firmware and the rest of the fleet still retransmit, so McApp's airtime caps
  must stay set against the four-keying case until this reaches every node we talk to — see §9.

- **Reply signal is only attributable when the pong has no via-path** (§1.4 point 2) — and in
  today's fleet, relayed pongs are the observed norm.
- **UDP mode only.** BLE clients cannot see pongs (§1.4 point 4). Note that UDP is always on and
  BLE is additive, so this is not a mode the box is "in" — the constraint is that a BLE-only client
  view cannot show this data, not that the endpoint should be refused.
- **One direction only.** RSSI/SNR is measured by the receiver and the pong carries no signal data,
  so we learn how well _we_ hear _them_ and never the reverse. This is not a symmetric link test
  and must not be presented as one.
- **Timeout has three meanings**: not in direct range, station off, or station in track mode
  (§1.4 point 1).
- **We cannot test against ourselves** (§1.4 point 8) — every end-to-end check needs a second
  station or a simulated responder.
- **We transmit under the operator's licence**, from an endpoint with no authentication. Caps must
  be enforced server-side, not in the UI.
- **Incomplete self-view**: we see pings addressed to us but not the pong our node auto-sends
  (§1.4 point 6).
- A future firmware could change the pong payload shape. Correlation must fail soft.

### 4.3 Neutral

- No MeshCom-server interaction whatsoever; this never leaves the local RF neighbourhood.
- No schema change (§3.2).

## 5. Firmware sync note

**Done 2026-08-14** — the three on-air exchanges in §1.5 were run against the firmware actually on
`DK5EN-98`, which is the re-verification this section asked for. Repeat it after any node firmware
update: re-verify against the firmware actually running on the target node that `loop_functions.cpp:3103/3184/3395/3466`, `lora_functions.cpp:701/756/773` and
`extudp_functions.cpp:365` are unchanged — the correlation scheme and the airtime estimate depend
on all of them, and §1.4 point 7 in particular is local-fork code. New upstream tags at time of
writing: `v4.35p.08.03`, `v4.35p.08.06`, `v4.35p.08.10.2`.

**Corrected 2026-09-25:** the line numbers above are from 2026-08 and have drifted (the fork has
moved through several campaigns since). Re-verify by function name instead of line, and do not
attempt to renumber this section: the `OnRxDone()` `{pong}` branch (§1.4 point 4), the
retransmission-status handling in `sendMessage()` (§1.4 point 7), and `SendPong()` / `sendPing()`
(§1.3b, §9) are the three places this ADR's claims depend on.

## 6. Post-deploy verification (2026-08-14, `v1.6.14-dev.35`)

Re-run against the deployed stack on `mcapp.local`, not a test harness. The SSE stream is the one
the webapp consumes:

```
event: proxy:linkcheck_sent    {"target": "DL2JA-2", "seq": 1}
event: proxy:linkcheck_result  {"seq": 1, "response_ms": 21410, "rssi": -118, "snr": -7.0, "hops": 0, "late": false}
event: proxy:linkcheck_done    {"sent": 1, "received": 1, "status": "completed"}
```

`-118 dBm` sits with the pre-release `-117/-127/-119`, and `21.4 s` with `23.8/42.6/29.3` — the
deployed behaviour matches what §1.5 measured. `hops: 0`, so the signal is attributable to
`DL2JA-2` itself.

Both ingest behaviours confirmed on the live DB: **zero** `{ping}`/`{pong}` rows in `messages`
since deploy (13 historical rows predate the fix and were deliberately left), and the pong's signal
reached `signal_log` as `source='lora', rssi=-118, snr=-7.0`. That pair is exactly what the guard
placement in the implementation plan §1.1 exists to preserve.

API surface on the box: `GET /api/linkcheck/sessions` → `{"sessions":[]}`; self-ping → 400 with the
firmware-level reason; `count=500` → 422. Note the API is on port **2981** (lighttpd proxies it at
8082); 8081 is the BLE service.

### 6.1 Browser verification (2026-08-14)

Driven in Chrome against `http://mcapp.local/webapp/positions`. Footer read `v1.6.14-dev.35`, so
the browser was running the new bundle and not a stale service-worker copy.

**Verified working:**

- the **Link check** button renders on every station card
- clicking it starts a real session — the box logged
  `_udp_message_handler: src_type='linkcheck' src=None dst=DL2JA-2 msg={ping}`
- the card flips to **Stop** / _"Checking…"_ while in flight
- the timeout renders as **"No direct-RF answer"**, not "station down"
- the action's accessible name is the intended honest wording verbatim:
  `Link check DL2JA-2 — transmits on air: about 4 transmissions over up to two minutes`

**NOT verified: the success render.** Both browser attempts timed out. That was checked rather
than assumed — no pong reached the box at all, so these were genuine no-answers rather than a UI
fault, and the timeout came from the backend's 90 s timer (`LinkCheckStore` contains no
`setTimeout`; it is purely event-driven off `proxy:linkcheck_timeout`). The success **data** path
is proven at API and SSE level (§6, `response_ms 21410, rssi -118, hops 0`), but no successful
result has been seen rendered in the DOM.

**The link degraded during the session**, which is itself worth recording: `DL2JA-2` answered 4 of
5 attempts earlier in the day and 0 of 2 an hour later, with its beacon signal drifting from
`-117 dBm / SNR -4` to `-127 dBm / SNR -16`. A marginal link is not a stable test fixture. Anyone
re-verifying this should pick a strong neighbour (`DB0ED-99`, `DB0ISM-1`) rather than `DL2JA-2`.

## 7. Current state (2026-08-14)

**Shipped and live** in `v1.6.14-dev.35` on `mcapp.local`: parser and correlation, ingest guard,
session engine, REST API, SSE events, and the station-list UI. CI green on every commit in both
repos. Working docs archived under `doc/archive/`.

Known gaps, none blocking:

Worth doing in the firmware fork, independently of McApp: add `{ping}` to the
`{CET}`/`{MCP}`/`{SET}` no-retransmit exclusion list at `loop_functions.cpp:3468`. That cuts a
proxy-originated ping from ~4 keyings to 1 and removes the 40 s quantisation from the measured
time (§1.4 point 7, §1.5.4).

**Fixed in the fork firmware (2026-09-25):** done on `feature-neighbour-matrix` and
`fork-neo-test`; `fork-main` in progress. See §1.4 point 7 and §9.

## 8. Amendment 2026-09-24: transport-agnostic pong, node-id correlation

Field report from DM3KS-12 (v2.0.13): ping `x2EFB0228` to DM3KS-13 went out, the pong
`{pong}{788202024}` (== `0x2EFB0228`) came back 7 s later, direct, RSSI -33 — and the modal still
timed out. The node's Extern-UDP pointed at a MeshCom WebDesk PC, not at McApp. The firmware
sends the `"node"` echo AND the pong to the same EXT IP (`sendExtern()`), so McApp saw neither.

McApp now accepts a pong from either transport and correlates without the echo:

- **The ping goes out over BLE whenever a BLE client is connected**, UDP otherwise. With EXTUDP
  off the node never reads the UDP socket (`esp32_main.cpp`: `if(bEXTUDP) getExternUDP();`), so a
  UDP-only sender transmitted nothing while the modal still said "ping sent" (DK5EN-98 -> DK5EN-1,
  2026-09-24, EXTUDP off). A BLE-sent ping is still echoed to Extern-UDP when the EXT IP points
  here, and the node also hands it back over BLE (observed live: `{ping}{487`, msg_id `1AE1E1E7`,
  `src == DK5EN-98`, no path, `src_type:"ble_remote"`), so the exact correlation survives EXTUDP
  off. BLE frames arrive as `"ble_remote"` (restamped by `ble_client_remote`); `"ble"` is accepted
  too.

- **An RF pong is an RF pong regardless of transport.** Extern-UDP `src_type:"lora"` and a BLE
  copy without the server flag (`msg_server`, byte-5 bit 0x80) both resolve the attempt. Extern-UDP
  `src_type:"udp"` and a BLE copy WITH the server flag are the internet path (`internet_reply`),
  exactly as before. Only the Extern-UDP copy has RSSI/SNR; a BLE-first resolve waits 2 s
  (`LINKCHECK_SIGNAL_GRACE_S`) for it and re-emits `linkcheck_result` with the signal filled in.
  BLE hop count comes from `via`, where `split_path` keeps the relay path.
- **Node-id correlation when no echo was seen.** Every id the firmware mints is
  `((_GW_ID & 0x3FFFFF) << 10) | counter`, and the firmware itself uses
  `(msgId >> 10) == (gwId & 0x3FFFFF)` to recognise its own messages (`ack_attribution.h`). McApp
  learns `_GW_ID` from the BLE `I` register (`ID`) or from any echo, and accepts a pong whose token
  carries our node's prefix, from the station the session is pinging, for an attempt that never
  learned its id. It proves "the target answered a ping from our node", not "this ping": a ping
  another client sent through the same node, or a late answer to an earlier timed-out attempt,
  matches too. A token is credited once (`_linkcheck_claimed_tokens`, 180 s).

**Firmware precondition, not met today:** a `{pong}` addressed to our node is only queued for
the display (`lora_functions.cpp`, the `{pong}` branch: `queueDisplayText()`, no
`addBLEOutBuffer()`, §1.4 point 4). So a box whose Extern-UDP points elsewhere still gets no pong
at all until the firmware forwards it to BLE. With EXT IP pointing at McApp, the exact echo path
works as before.

**Corrected 2026-09-25:** this precondition is now met — see §1.4 point 4 and §9. Nodes on the
DK5EN fork build from 2026-09-24 onward forward `{pong}` to BLE, so a box whose Extern-UDP points
elsewhere (e.g. a MeshCom WebDesk PC, the DM3KS-12 case this section opened with) is no longer
blind on BLE, provided the node itself runs the fixed firmware. Official firmware and upstream are
unchanged, so this remains McApp's problem for any node not on the fork — the transport-agnostic
design this section describes still carries that case.

## 9. Amendment 2026-09-25: firmware fixed in the DK5EN fork

Both firmware limitations §8 documented as structural — no BLE pong, unbounded ping
retransmission — are now fixes in the DK5EN fork, not permanent constraints. This section records
what changed, what is still in progress, a new fork-only regression this campaign found, and a
fresh live verification of the fixed stack end to end.

### 9.1 P13 — pong now reaches BLE

Covered inline at §1.4 point 4 and §8. Summary: `OnRxDone()`'s `{pong}` branch
(`src/lora_functions.cpp`) now calls `addBLEOutBuffer()` like every other DM to the node.
Commits: `feature-neighbour-matrix` `14a669cf`, `fork-neo-test` `3b018f03`, `fork-main`
`0e271c17`. Live on DK5EN-98 and DK5EN-1 since 2026-09-24 ~23:26.

### 9.2 P14 — a ping sent through `sendMessage()` is keyed once

Covered inline at §1.4 point 7, §4.2 and §7. Summary: the retransmission arm that used to fire for
any DM not starting `{CET}`/`{MCP}`/`{SET}` no longer fires for `{ping}`; the ping keeps
personal-DM priority at enqueue, which is why the fix is not simply "mark it no-retry" — that would
have re-ranked it as a relay in the TX ring. Commits: `feature-neighbour-matrix` `df0ea8c1`,
`fork-neo-test` `1a14bef5`. `fork-main`: in progress, entangled with §9.3 below.

### 9.3 fork-main only, in progress: DM Stage 0 breaks `{ping}` in transit

`fork-main`'s DM Stage 0 (commit `7aeb2ac5`) rewrites every `{` in DM text to `(` at the sender, so
a McApp ping routed through a `fork-main` node left that node as `(ping}{NNN` — no longer a
recognisable ping. The target ACKs it as an ordinary DM and never pongs; the link check times out
with no error anywhere. Being fixed by exempting a leading `{ping}` and `{SET}` from that rewrite.
**No released build contains `7aeb2ac5`** — this affects only an unreleased `fork-main` build from
after 2026-09-13, not anything currently deployed. McApp link checks routed through such a build
time out; this is why P14's `fork-main` port (§9.2) is bundled with this fix rather than shipped
alone.

### 9.4 In progress on all three branches: pong priority

`sendPing()` and `SendPong()` currently enqueue at relay priority (NORMAL) on every firmware,
including the fork. On a busy target the pong queues behind ACKs, DMs and group traffic — part of
why the response times in §1.5.4 run as long as they do. Being fixed in the fork on
`feature-neighbour-matrix`, `fork-neo-test` and `fork-main`; not yet landed anywhere as of this
amendment.

### 9.5 Live verification, 2026-09-25 07:56:47

McApp v2.0.14, `mcapp.local`, DK5EN-98 via BLE, Extern-UDP off. Link check DK5EN-98 → DK5EN-1:
`{ping}{556` (msg_id `1AE1E22C`), pong `{pong}{451011116}` (== `0x1AE1E22C`) received over BLE
after 12 s, direct (no via). UI: "Direct RF path confirmed — answered in 12 s",
"completed — 1 sent, 1 received". DK5EN-1's USB capture shows the ping received **exactly once**
(capture ran live through 07:59:41, past the retry window) — P14 confirmed on the receiving end,
not just the sender's echo. McApp's monitor shows the pong itself as `dropped · linkcheck` (the
Stage 0 ingest filter at §3.1, working as designed) and the ping row's "x2" is McApp's own send
plus the node's BLE echo, not a retransmission. This is also the frame pair §1.4 point 2's
gateway-upload correction cites: DK5EN-1 logged `GWU x1AE1E22C` for this same ping.

### 9.6 What is still unchanged

Official MeshCom firmware and upstream `dev` have neither fix; there is no upstream PR yet for
either — the stock phone app would render a `{pong}{id}` as an ordinary chat bubble
(`Meshcom-MobileApp/src/hooks/MessageHandler.ts` discards only `{CET}`, nothing ping/pong-shaped).
McApp must keep working correctly against nodes without these fixes — no BLE pong, retransmitted
pings — and the §8 transport-agnostic design already does; nothing in this amendment changes that
requirement, it only removes the failure mode for the subset of the fleet that is on the DK5EN
fork post-2026-09-24.
