# McApp production health log — mcapp.local

> **Status:** Current — newest section: §7 (2026-09-01, v2.0.2 promoted to production).
> Newest sweep: §7 (2026-09-01 15:45 CEST) — box **all green**. Its one finding (**F13**, a 6.07 h
> `{CET}` uplink outage) was upstream and **resolved the same evening at 18:38 CEST**, which also
> verified the v2.0.2 gap-close path and re-confirmed the 606.8 s cadence.
> Open watch points: **W1** (zram swap, 59 MB out — improving), **W2** (live `config.json` stays
> `0640` by decision), **W3** (Caddy 12 h certs), **W6** and **W7** (§6, accepted residual risks).
> **W4** (§3), **W5** (§5) and **W8** (§7) are resolved.
>
> **Kind:** Recurring ops review; one dated section per run, appended, never edited in place.
> **Produced by:** the `ai-ops` skill (`.claude/skills/ai-ops/SKILL.md`).

## How to use this document

The next run works through the `ai-ops` phases, compares against the **rate table in §1**, and
**appends a new dated section** rather than editing an existing one. Findings are numbered
`F<n>` continuing the series across runs, so a finding can be referred to by number later.

**Raw counters are useless for comparison across different uptimes.** A run six hours after a
deploy and a run six days after one produce wildly different `messages` totals from an identical,
healthy box. §1 therefore carries **per-hour rates with the window each was measured over**;
totals are recorded only as context.

Absence is the result for most of these checks. **Quote the zero** rather than staying silent
about it — a missing line in a report is indistinguishable from a check that was never run.

## 1. Rate baseline

Established 2026-08-22. Re-measure each run; a rate that moves by more than about a factor of two
deserves a sentence explaining why before it is dismissed.

| Signal                          | Rate               | Window | Notes                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `messages` type `msg`           | **11 / h**         | 1 h    | Chat traffic; varies with time of day, weakest signal here  |
| `messages` type `pos`           | **87 / h**         | 1 h    | Position + MHeard beacons, throttled 2 min per station      |
| `signal_log`                    | **347 / h**        | 1 h    | Raw RSSI/SNR rows                                           |
| `{CET}` uplink beacon           | **~303 s** cadence | live   | Measured twice independently — see §2                       |
| journal warnings (`-p warning`) | **0 / 24 h**       | 24 h   | A jump into the hundreds is the signal, not the exact count |
| unclassified `msg`              | **0**              | 1 h    | Classifier keeping up                                       |
| `{CET}` rows in `messages`      | **0**              | all    | Dropped at ingest; absence is correct                       |

Structural values that should change only when we change them: schema **25**, system epoch **1**,
classifier version **3** with **38** rules.

## 2. 2026-08-22 07:48 CEST — first full sweep

**Verdict: all green. Zero findings, four watch points.** First sweep after `v2.0.1-dev.1` shipped
the gateway-uptime feature (deployed 00:53:51 the same night).

### Absent signals — the point of the exercise

- `{CET}` rows in `messages`: **0**. Dropped at ingest by `_should_filter_message`; correct.
- Unclassified `msg` rows in the last hour: **0**.
- `udp_untrusted_source_ips`: **empty**; `udp_multiple_sources` **false**; `udp_target_kind`
  `identified`; `udp_suppressed_target_changes` **0**. Nothing is injecting on the
  unauthenticated port 1799.
- Gateway-uptime `gap`/`dark` rows: **0** after 6 h 54 m — roughly **81 consecutive beacon
  cycles** with no missed beacon and no false positive from the 6-minute tolerance.

### Gateway uptime — first production data

The feature shipped in this release, so this is its first field measurement.

| Value           | Reading                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `state`         | `active`                                         |
| `uptime_pct`    | 100.0 %                                          |
| `coverage_pct`  | 28.58 % (411.5 of 1440 min — ledger began 00:54) |
| longest outage  | 0 ms                                             |
| last beacon age | 299 s                                            |
| heartbeat age   | 5 s (30 s tick)                                  |

**Beacon cadence measured twice, independently, same answer:** 303 s from the client-side SSE
stream (`23:40:31 → 23:45:34 → 23:50:37`) and 302 s from the DB ledger's own up-run
(`01:01:23 → 01:06:26`). This is what `GAP_TOLERANCE_MS = 6 min` is calibrated against — the
02:00-era provisional of 3 min would have written an outage row on every one of those healthy
cycles.

### Watch points — named, not findings

- **W1 — swap.** ~142 MB swapped out under zram, 181 MB RAM still available. Normal for a Pi
  Zero 2W; becomes a finding if SwapFree trends toward zero.
- **W2 — `config.json` is `0640`**, group-readable, and contains `BLE_API_KEY` in clear.
  Single-user box, so low severity. `0600` would be tidier.
- **W3 — Caddy cert always looks near-expiry.** Internal CA, 12-hour leaf certs, auto-renewed
  (`notBefore Aug 21 23:39Z → notAfter Aug 22 11:39Z`, read at 05:48Z = mid-life). Never report
  this as an expiry finding without reading the issuer and `notBefore`.
- **W4 — `uptime_pct` reads 100.0 before the first-ever beacon.** The Settings card correctly
  renders "No data yet" for `state: unknown`, so it is invisible in the UI, but any other API
  consumer would be misled. Small backend fix, not yet scheduled.

### Carried forward, unchanged

- 169 pre-2026-08-13 duplicate telemetry pairs, still unexplained.
- `fcs_ok` field-data verdict due after 2026-09-20 (`doc/backlog.md`).

### Skill changes this run produced

The sweep improved its own instrument, committed as `ed82c25`:

- Swap was uncovered by the host phase on a box that steadily swaps; now read from
  `/proc/meminfo` (English regardless of the shell's German locale, and no `$field` references).
- The Caddy 12-hour cert would have triggered a false alarm on every future run; the issuer and
  `notBefore` must now be read before judging `notAfter`.

Earlier in the same night, the first run of the Phase 4 query returned `None` for the classifier
because the DB key is `classifier_version` while the code calls the concept `classifier_ver` —
a silent `None`, indistinguishable from a dead classifier. Corrected in `e8a1593`.

## 3. 2026-08-22 — follow-up fixes from §2's watch points

Not a sweep. Records what was done about §2's watch points, so the next run does not re-chase them.
Per this document's own rule §2 is left exactly as it was written.

### W4 — resolved

`uptime_pct` reported **100.0** on a ledger that had never recorded a beacon: the read path
anchored its live-tail gap on `last_beacon_ms`, so with that NULL no gap could be derived and the
hole-filling step painted the stretch `up`. Now, with no beacon ever recorded, the silence is
measured from `first_observed_ms` and split on the existing `GAP_TOLERANCE_MS`:

| elapsed since `first_observed_ms` | segment | `uptime_pct` |
| --------------------------------- | ------- | ------------ |
| `<= GAP_TOLERANCE_MS`             | `dark`  | `null`       |
| `> GAP_TOLERANCE_MS`              | `gap`   | `0.0`        |

`state` stays `unknown` in both cases and the has-beaconed path is untouched. `dark` is
deliberately widened from "the proxy was not running" to "no observation is available for this
stretch", which now also covers "running, but has never heard anything yet".

**A fresh ledger reporting 100.0 % again means this regressed.**

### W2 — resolved for new writes; the live box is unchanged by design

`/etc/mcapp/config.json` holds `BLE_API_KEY` in clear and was written `0640`. Both writers in
`bootstrap/lib/config.sh` now set **`0600`** explicitly, and both `.bak` copies are created with
`install -m 600`.

A second, separate defect was found in the same file and is also fixed: `migrate_config()` did
`mv "$tmp_config" "$CONFIG_FILE"` with **no chmod**, inheriting `mktemp`'s `0600`, while
`write_config()` set `0640` — so the deployed mode depended on which writer ran last. Both are
now explicit.

Per decision, **no retroactive chmod** was added to the deploy path: the running box keeps its
existing `0640` until someone runs `--reconfigure`. Expect `0640` on mcapp.local at the next
sweep and do not report it as a regression.

### Correction to a claim made while chasing W2

While investigating, the `.bak` files were asserted to be world-readable `0644`, reasoned from
`0666 & ~umask` with root's umask at `0022`. **That was wrong, and the reasoning was never
tested.** Measured on mcapp.local (GNU coreutils 9.7): `cp` **preserves the source file's mode**
— a `0640` source yields a `0640` copy, a `0600` source yields `0600`. The backups were never
world-readable. (macOS's BSD `cp` differs again, which is why this had to be measured on the
target rather than locally.)

The fixes above remain worth having as hardening and for determinism, but they close **no live
exposure**. Recorded here so the claim is not repeated from the transcript.

### Verification

`config_migration` cannot run on macOS (bash 3.2; `config.sh` is bash-4-only by design), so it was
run on mcapp.local (bash 5.2.37) against scratch configs in `/tmp`, production untouched:

| Tree                                | Result           |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| new tests + **pre-fix** `config.sh` | **FAIL (15/20)** |
| new tests + **fixed** `config.sh`   | **PASS**         |

Five assertions flip — the two `migrate_config()` mode checks and the three `write_config()` ones.
Full local gate green otherwise: ruff, `ruff format --check .` (161 files), mypy (91 files),
`run_startup_tests.py` exit 0 with `uptime: PASS`, 47 suites PASS.

## 4. 2026-08-22 17:53 CEST — second full sweep (pre-release check for v2.0.1)

**Verdict: all green. Zero findings.** Run to answer one question: is `v2.0.1-dev.2` fit to be
promoted to a production `v2.0.1`. Answer: yes. The gateway-uptime feature recorded its **first
real `gap`** in this window — it is upstream and the metric behaved exactly as designed.

### Anchors

| Anchor              | Value                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Snapshot            | 2026-08-22 17:49–17:53 CEST                                  |
| Release             | `v2.0.1-dev.2` (`/webapp/version.html` agrees)               |
| App version         | `v2.0.1` (`/api/status`)                                     |
| Active slot         | `slot-2` (rotated from `slot-1`)                             |
| Schema              | **25** = `LATEST_SCHEMA_VERSION` ✓                           |
| System epoch        | installed **1** = `REQUIRED_SYSTEM_EPOCH` = `SYSTEM_EPOCH` ✓ |
| Service start       | 2026-08-22 08:54:49 CEST                                     |
| Process uptime      | 32 096 s ≈ **8.9 h**                                         |
| `systemd NRestarts` | **0** (mcapp and mcapp-ble)                                  |
| Host uptime         | 3 days, 19:32                                                |

The 08:54:49 restart is the `v2.0.1-dev.2` deploy, not a crash: `NRestarts` is still 0 on both
units, and the slot symlink moved `slot-1 → slot-2`.

### Rates — measured against §1

| Signal              | §1 baseline | This run     | Window | Verdict                                      |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `messages` `msg`    | 11 / h      | **7 / h**    | 1 h    | within noise; Saturday afternoon vs. morning |
| `messages` `pos`    | 87 / h      | **74 / h**   | 1 h    | within noise                                 |
| `signal_log`        | 347 / h     | **310 / h**  | 1 h    | within noise                                 |
| journal warnings    | 0 / 24 h    | **0 / 24 h** | 24 h   | `-- No entries --`                           |
| unclassified `msg`  | 0           | **0**        | 1 h    | classifier keeping up                        |
| `{CET}` in messages | 0           | **0**        | all    | dropped at ingest; absence is correct        |

Nothing moved by even a factor of 1.5. A **10-hour** cross-check against §2's totals gives lower
mean rates than the 1-hour spot sample (`signal_log` +2 405 rows over 10.05 h = **239 / h** mean
vs. 310 / h spot; `messages` +537 = **53 / h** mean vs. 81 / h spot for `msg`+`pos` combined),
which is the expected shape for a diurnal RF band — the 1-hour window happened to catch a busy
stretch. Neither figure is a concern; recorded so a future run reading ~240 / h does not chase it.

Structural values all unchanged: schema **25**, epoch **1**, classifier version **3** with **38**
rules and markers `backfill_done:v0/v1/v3`.

### Measured

| Check            | Value                                                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Services         | mcapp, mcapp-ble, caddy, lighttpd all `active`                    |
| `/health`        | `healthy`                                                         |
| DB size          | **31 MB** of the 1 GB limit (3.1 %); **no `-wal` file** at all    |
| Totals (context) | 19 583 messages, 221 stations, 57 931 signal rows                 |
| Disk             | 3.8 G used of 59 G = **7 %**                                      |
| MemAvailable     | **161 MB** of 415 MB (was 181 MB in §2)                           |
| Swap             | SwapFree 329 004 of 424 956 kB → **~94 MB swapped out** (was 142) |
| Load / temp      | 0.20 / 0.10 / 0.03 · **44.0 °C**                                  |
| Journal warnings | **0** in 24 h                                                     |

Swap pressure **improved** by ~48 MB across the deploy while available RAM fell ~20 MB — the net
is a wash and both sit comfortably inside the envelope §2 established for this box.

### Absent signals

- `{CET}` rows in `messages`: **0**.
- Unclassified `msg` rows in the last hour: **0**.
- `udp_target_kind` `identified`, `udp_known_source_ips` `["192.168.68.56"]`,
  `udp_multiple_sources` **false**, `udp_untrusted_source_ips` **empty**,
  `udp_suppressed_target_changes` **0**. Nothing is injecting on the unauthenticated port 1799.
- Journal warnings in 24 h: **0** (literal `-- No entries --`).
- WAL file: **absent** — checkpointed clean, not a stalled checkpoint.
- `dark` rows from the 08:54 deploy restart: **0**, and that is correct. The restart was shorter
  than `DARK_THRESHOLD_MS` (3 missed 30 s heartbeats), so `reconcile_link_uptime_startup` left the
  state untouched by design — "a deploy restart must never read as a link outage".

### The first recorded `{CET}` gap — upstream, and the metric worked

`GET /api/uptime?range=24h` (note: `range` is **required**; the bare endpoint returns 422):

| Value           | Reading                                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `state`         | `active`                                                 |
| `uptime_pct`    | **99.007 %**                                             |
| `coverage_pct`  | 70.61 % (ledger began 00:54:02, so 24 h is not yet full) |
| longest outage  | **605 822 ms** = 10.1 min                                |
| last beacon age | 8 s                                                      |
| heartbeat age   | 14 s (30 s tick)                                         |
| thresholds      | `silent_ms` 360 000 · `off_ms` 900 000                   |

The single `gap` segment: **12:43:07 → 12:53:13**, 606 s. That is **exactly 2 × 303 s**, and the
recovering beacon landed exactly on cadence — so precisely **one** `{CET}` frame was lost, not a
ten-minute outage. It is also a third independent confirmation of the **303 s** cadence.

**The RF side was demonstrably healthy throughout.** Between 12:38 and 12:58 the proxy stored 36
`pos` rows from 20 distinct stations and 158 `signal_log` rows, with no interruption spanning the
gap. The node and the UDP path to the proxy were fine; what dropped was the node's uplink to the
MeshCom server. **Upstream, not ours — no action.**

This is also the documented one-cadence resolution meeting real data: **a single lost frame costs
~1 % of a 24 h window.** Do not read 99 % as a degraded link.

### Watch points

- **W1 — swap.** Carried, and improved: ~94 MB swapped out (from 142), 161 MB available. Still a
  WATCH, not a finding.
- **W2 — `config.json` is `0640` on the live box.** Confirmed still `0640`, exactly as §3
  predicted. `vapid.json` is **`0600`** ✓. This is the decided state until someone runs
  `--reconfigure`; **do not report it as a regression.**
- **W3 — Caddy cert always looks near-expiry.** Confirmed again: `notBefore Aug 22 07:49:37 GMT →
notAfter Aug 22 19:49:37 GMT`, read at 15:52 GMT = mid-life, issuer
  `CN=Caddy Local Authority - ECC Intermediate`. Healthy.
- **W4 — resolved, and the fix is live.** The `first_observed_ms` fallback is present in the
  active slot (`storage/uptime.py:155`). It cannot be re-tested against this ledger, which has
  beacons; the regression tripwire remains "a fresh ledger reporting 100.0 %".
- **W5 (new) — webapp `main` carries an untagged merge.** `be6089d` ("Merge development: admin
  history cards") was merged and pushed to webapp `main` at 2026-08-22 00:46 and carries no tag;
  webapp `package.json` still reads `2.0.0` while the deployed build reports `v2.0.1-dev.2`.
  Harmless today, but it means webapp `main` is one commit ahead of its own `development` with no
  release naming it. Worth tidying when v2.0.1 is cut.

### Release readiness — v2.0.1

Asked and answered: **yes.**

`config_migration` is `SKIPPED — NOT VERIFIED` locally (macOS bash 3.2; the suite is bash-4-only
by design). It was run for real on mcapp.local per §3 and it runs on every CI push (ubuntu, bash
5). Not a gap in coverage, only in the local instrument.

`development` is **13 commits ahead of `main`** (`main` still at `dc27612`, the v2.0.0 merge).
Promotion is the ordinary `scripts/release.sh` path from `development`.

### Skill changes this run produced

- Phase 3's `version.html` note gave no path. `curl -sk https://mcapp.local/version.html` returns
  a lighttpd **404**, which reads exactly like a broken frontend deploy; the file is served at
  **`/webapp/version.html`**. Path added to the skill.
- Phase 5 reads the ledger from the DB but never names the HTTP surface. `GET /api/uptime`
  **requires** `?range=` (`24h` / `7d`) and returns a 422 without it. Added.

## 5. 2026-08-22 18:10 CEST — v2.0.1 promoted to production

Not a sweep. Records the promotion §4 cleared, and the post-deploy verification, so the next run
knows what changed under it.

`v2.0.1` was cut from `v2.0.1-dev.2` (`bc12783`, plus the §4 log entry and the release notes) and
deployed from the webapp Update page. GitHub release:
<https://github.com/DK5EN/McApp/releases/tag/v2.0.1>, sha256

### The uptime ledger survived the deploy cleanly

This is the first time the gateway-uptime feature has been carried through a release deploy, so it
is worth pinning what happened:

- `first_observed_ms` still **00:54:02** — untouched.
- **No `dark` row was written**, and that is correct: the service was down for less than
  `DARK_THRESHOLD_MS` (3 missed 30 s heartbeats), so `reconcile_link_uptime_startup` left the state
  as it found it. A production deploy does not read as a link outage.
- The only segment in the ledger is still the single 12:43:07 → 12:53:13 `gap` from §4.
- Beacon arrived 198 s after the restart, heartbeat 30 s — both inside their envelopes.
- `uptime_pct` 99.03 %, `coverage_pct` 71.93 % — continuous with §4's reading, no discontinuity.

### W5 — resolved

webapp `main` carried `be6089d`, a development merge that was never merged back, leaving `main` one
commit ahead of its own `development`. That state aborts `release.sh`'s `validate_main_mergeable`
and **blocked the release**. Merged back non-destructively (the trees were identical, so the merge
was purely topological) and pushed.

**The root cause is structural and will recur.** `post_release_prep` pushes **MCProxy**
`development` only; the webapp's merge-back from step 10 is committed and never pushed, so every
production release leaves webapp `development` behind `origin/main` until someone pushes it by hand
— which is exactly what aborts the _next_ release. Documented as Stop 4 in the new `prod-release`
skill, with the manual push as an explicit step.

### Related work this produced

- **`prod-release` skill** (`.claude/skills/prod-release/SKILL.md`) — the production counterpart to
  `dev-release`, covering the four stops that abort or silently bite: release notes must be
  committed _before_ the script starts (its clean-tree check runs first), `main` must not be ahead
  in either repo, the notes prompt is a bare `read` that `< /dev/null` kills into the rollback trap,
  and the webapp `development` push the script never performs.

### Open, unchanged

- 169 pre-2026-08-13 duplicate telemetry pairs, still unexplained.
- `fcs_ok` field-data verdict due after 2026-09-20 (`doc/backlog.md`).
- webapp `package.json` still reads `2.0.0`; `post_release_prep` bumps only the two
  `pyproject.toml` files. Cosmetic today, but it means the webapp repo carries no version of its
  own that matches the release.

## 6. 2026-08-22 — fable review of the v2.0.1 release tooling, and its fixes

Not a sweep. Records an independent review of the release/deploy changes made after v2.0.1 shipped,
so the next run knows what moved and which risks were accepted deliberately.

Eight independent finders, then adversarial verification; only claims reproduced by experiment were
acted on. **Two of the three high findings were defects in the fixes themselves.**

### Fixed

| #   | Defect                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Where                            |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1   | `install_webapp_tree` was called as `f \|\| return 1` / `if ! f`, which suppresses errexit for the **whole function body** — `rm -rf`, `mkdir -p`, `chown -R`, `chmod -R` failed silently and the swap still happened, returning 0 | `bootstrap/lib/deploy.sh`        |
| 2   | `release.sh` announced _"Rollback complete."_ on a step-11 failure while doing **nothing** — `cleanup_artifacts` had already cleared every flag the trap inspects                                                                  | `scripts/release.sh`             |
| 3   | The webapp-push regression test was **tautological**: its fixture pushed before the call, so it passed with the push removed                                                                                                       | `scripts/release_prep_tests.py`  |
| 4   | The deploy suite drove the function without `-e` while production has it, and asserted the AppleDouble guarantee by grepping release.sh's **source text**                                                                          | `scripts/webapp_deploy_tests.py` |
| 5   | `mcapp-ble.service` embeds `BLE_API_KEY` in cleartext and was written `0644` (pre-existing)                                                                                                                                        | `bootstrap/lib/deploy.sh`        |
| 6   | webapp `.prettierignore` covered only `*_vectors.json`, leaving `dedup_contract.json` and `push_contract.json` reformattable                                                                                                       | webapp repo                      |

Every fix was confirmed by **mutation**: reverting it makes the relevant suite fail, restoring it
makes the suite pass. A green suite was not accepted as evidence on its own — finding 3 is precisely
the case where it was wrong.

### Accepted residual risks — deliberate, do not re-litigate

- **W6 — the swap has a sub-millisecond window with no serve directory.** `install_webapp_tree`
  stages then swaps with two renames. Killed exactly between them, `/var/www/html/webapp` is absent
  and **stays** absent until the next deploy: `system_converge.py`'s watchdog is scoped to
  `SYSTEM_EPOCH` and never calls `deploy_webapp`. It is not data loss — the source is always the
  freshly extracted tarball — and the next deploy self-heals, because `[[ -d "$WEBAPP_DIR" ]]` is
  false and `get_installed_webapp_version` returns `not_installed`, forcing a redeploy.
  Recovery by hand: `sudo mv /var/www/html/webapp.old /var/www/html/webapp`.
  Not fixed: closing it properly needs a symlinked serve directory (`ln -sfn` is atomic where a
  directory rename is not), which means `server.follow-symlink` in lighttpd — a front-door change,
  therefore a `SYSTEM_EPOCH` bump. Not worth it for a ~10 ms window on a single-user box.
- **W7 — stale clients can lose assets the old overlay preserved.** Replacing the tree deletes the
  previous build's content-hashed chunks. A tab whose service worker finished precaching is
  unaffected (Workbox precaches every built asset, including never-visited lazy chunks); the
  exposure is a tab whose SW never completed, hitting a new route after a deploy. Accepted — the
  alternative is unbounded accumulation, which is what §5 set out to fix.

### Refuted — do not re-investigate

- _"A step-11 failure deletes the published release and both repos' tags."_ Asserted in-session,
  **wrong**: `cleanup_artifacts` clears `_CLEANUP_TAG`/`_CLEANUP_RELEASE` at step 10. The trap has
  nothing left to delete; the real defect was that it claimed a rollback anyway (fixed above).
- `chmod -R 755` on served files — identical in the pre-change code and inert; lighttpd loads no
  CGI/FastCGI/magnet module.
- `rm -rf` with an unset `WEBAPP_DIR` — unreachable; `readonly` and hardcoded in `bootstrap/mcapp.sh`.
- Symlink/TOCTOU on `webapp.new`/`.old` — defeated by coreutils' non-follow defaults, and
  `/var/www/html` is not writable by any non-root account.
- `src/**/*_vectors.json` failing to match files directly under `src/` — `**` matches zero
  directories in gitignore semantics; verified with prettier.

## 7. 2026-09-01 15:45 CEST — v2.0.2 promoted to production

Post-release sweep after promoting `v2.0.2-dev.9` to **v2.0.2** and deploying it. Verdict: **all
green on the box, one live finding that is not ours** — the `{CET}` uplink has been down since
12:34 CEST, three hours before the deploy, while RF traffic is completely normal. That is the exact
situation the Gateway Availability feature was built to make visible, and it is reporting it
correctly.

### The webapp tree-replace fix, measured

The reason §6 shipped `install_webapp_tree`. Right after v2.0.1 the serve directory held 868 files
and 26 MB for a release containing 70, plus 133 AppleDouble `._*` sidecars. After this deploy:

| Signal                          | After v2.0.1 | After v2.0.2 |
| ------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Files in `/var/www/html/webapp` | 868          | **70**       |
| AppleDouble `._*` sidecars      | 133          | **0**        |

Exactly the release contents, nothing carried over. The fix works in production, not only in its
suite.

### Migrations v26 / v27 / v28, verified against live data

All three touch existing rows, so each was checked for its intended effect rather than for a clean
exit code:

- **v26** — placeholder callsigns: **0** rows remain matching `XX0XXX*` / `DK0XXX*` / `DX0XXX*`
  across `station_positions`.
- **v27** — `lora_mod` is now `None` (307) or `8` (27), nothing above the low nibble. The old bug
  stored the packed byte, so a country-8 node read **131**; that value no longer exists in the
  table. `station_positions.gw` reads 215 `NULL` / 83 `0` / 36 `1` — the zeros are **re-learned**
  since v27 nulled them, which is the intended steady state (a `0` from a HEY frame is an
  authoritative "not a gateway").
- **v28** — the uptime ledger is repaired **and correctly bounded**. Only **3** gap segments survive
  after the 2026-08-27 07:45:59 cutoff: 19.3 min, 22.9 h and 20.2 min — all genuine outages, all
  well past the new 12 min tolerance. The 31 remaining sub-12-min gaps are all _before_ the cutoff
  and were kept on purpose, because the cadence still alternated there. The 210 spurious ones are
  gone.

Retuned thresholds confirmed live in the active slot: `GAP_TOLERANCE_MS = 720_000`,
`SILENT_MS = 720_000`, `OFF_MS = 1_800_000`.

### F13 — the `{CET}` uplink is genuinely down (upstream, not ours)

`/api/uptime?range=24h` at 15:48 CEST:

```
state             off
uptime_pct        81.39
coverage_pct      100.0
last_beacon_ms    2026-09-01 12:34:34 CEST
longest_outage    11_253_037 ms  (3.13 h, still open)
```

**This is not a release regression and not a threshold problem.** Three independent facts separate
the two cases, and this is why the check is worth writing down:

1. The gap opened at **12:34**, three hours _before_ the 15:39 deploy. The old build recorded its
   start; the new one continues the same open segment.
2. **Zero** `{CET}` matches in six hours of journal. CLAUDE.md's symptom rule — "uptime near zero
   while beacons are visibly arriving means `GAP_TOLERANCE_MS` is under the cadence" — needs
   beacons to be arriving. They are not. This is the opposite case.
3. **RF is completely healthy.** ~100 messages/h steady across all six hours, 29 stations in the
   last 60 min, 12 in the last 15, and ingest continued across the restart (rows at 15:40–15:42 on
   the new build).

A busy mesh with a silent server uplink is precisely the state no surface could distinguish before
v2.0.1, and `state: "off"` with `coverage_pct: 100` says it exactly: we were watching the whole
time, and there was nothing to hear.

**Action: none on our side.** `{CET}` originates at the MeshCom server. Watch for the beacon to
return and the ledger to close the segment; if it stays dark for many hours, it is an upstream
report, not a local fix.

#### F13 resolved, 18:38 CEST — and it verified the shipped recorder

The beacon returned at **18:38:32** after a **6.07 h** outage (12:34:34 → 18:38:32). The ledger
closed the gap at exactly that timestamp and opened an `up` run; `state` went `off` → `active`.
Confirmed upstream, not a defect in anything we ship.

Two things worth keeping:

- **This is the one v2.0.2 code path the promotion sweep could not exercise.** The retuned
  thresholds and migration v28 were verified against stored history, but a gap being _closed_ by
  a returning beacon needed a returning beacon. It behaved correctly on the new build.
- **Cadence re-measured: 606.8 s (10.11 min)**, from 18:38:32 → 18:48:39. Unchanged from the
  documented 606.5 s, so `GAP_TOLERANCE_MS` at 12 min keeps its intended 1.19x margin — **no
  retune needed.** Re-measuring here was the point: the cadence is set upstream by the MeshCom
  server and has already moved once, and a long outage is exactly the occasion on which it might
  have moved again.

The 24 h uptime reads **73.3 %** while the outage is still inside the window; it climbs out over
the following day. Coverage stayed **100 %** throughout — the proxy was watching the whole time.

| `/etc/systemd/system/mcapp-ble.service` | **600** | **§6 finding 5 is closed on the box** (was 644 with a cleartext `BLE_API_KEY`) |
| `/etc/mcapp/config.json`                | 640     | **W2** — unchanged by decision; moves on `--reconfigure`                       |

### Watch points

- **W8 — opened and closed within this section.** The `{CET}` uplink outage above: down 12:34:34,
  back 18:38:32, 6.07 h, upstream. Kept on the record so a future run reading a depressed 24 h
  uptime figure finds the cause here instead of re-diagnosing it as a threshold problem. The
  cadence was re-measured on recovery and is unchanged at 606.8 s.
- **W1 — swap. Carried, and improved again.** **59 MB** swapped out under zram (from 94 in §4,
  142 in §2), 355 MB SwapFree, 135 MB RAM available. Still a WATCH, not a finding; it becomes one
  if SwapFree trends toward zero.
- **W2 — `config.json` is `0640` on the live box.** Confirmed again. The decided state until
  someone runs `--reconfigure`; **do not report it as a regression.**
- **W3 — Caddy cert always looks near-expiry.** Confirmed healthy: issuer
  `CN=Caddy Local Authority - ECC Intermediate`, `notBefore Sep 1 12:38:16 GMT →
notAfter Sep 2 00:38:16 GMT`, read at 17:06 GMT = mid-life on a 12 h leaf.
- **W6, W7** carry forward unchanged (§6, accepted residual risks).
- **W5 is closed.** webapp `main` no longer runs ahead of its own `development`: `release.sh` now
  tags, bumps and **pushes** both repos, and both read `behind_main: 0` after this release.

> **Correction to an earlier draft of this section.** A first pass of these notes closed **W1**
> and credited it to the tree-replace measurement. That was wrong on both halves: W1 is **memory
> swap under zram**, and the directory-swap window in `install_webapp_tree` is **W6**, which is an
> accepted residual risk and stays open. Swap is measured above and carries forward. The
> `mcapp-ble.service` `0600` change closes **§6 finding 5**, not W5.

## 8. 2026-09-10 21:05 CEST — pre-release sweep before promoting v2.0.5-dev.2

Sign-off sweep for promoting `v2.0.5-dev.2` to **v2.0.5**. Verdict: **green on the box, short
soak by decision.** dev.1 ran 40 min and dev.2 about 25 min before this sweep; the operator chose
to promote rather than wait. Both dev tags were watched against live rows, not just health checks.

### Box

| Check                        | Result                                                                                                                 |

### Field verification of the release content

- **RX-01 trailer timestamp:** three foreign BLE rows after Extern-UDP was switched off carried
  the node clock as the stored timestamp, within seconds of the Pi's wall clock.
- **RX-04 flag bits:** DL5RAS-2 arrived with `mesh_info` 9 and the booleans read server+mesh,
  consistent with the nibble.
- **Duplicate enrichment:** first message after Extern-UDP came back (DL1RHS-14 → 9, 18:55:50
  UTC) is one UDP-won row with RSSI -120 / SNR -8 **and** hw 12 / mod 8 / mesh_info 1 /
  fcs_ok 1 from the BLE copy. Zero duplicate message ids in the window.
- **Not verified on air:** the 300 ms `0xA0` write gap (needs two back-to-back sends under the
  operator's callsign; not done on his behalf).

| **CI**                            | **`tests` workflow is `disabled_manually`** | **`CI` workflow is `disabled_manually`** |

### Watch points

- **W9 — CI is switched off in both repos.** `gh workflow list --all` shows `tests` (MCProxy)
  and `CI` (webapp) as `disabled_manually`; the last run on `development` was 2026-08-31.
  Every push since, including this release, has only the local gate behind it. Not changed by
  this sweep; the operator decides whether to re-enable.
- **W10 — `@lucide/vue` pinned at 1.41.0** in the webapp. 1.44.0 breaks the lint gate (45
  unsafe-assignment errors from its type declarations). Re-test on the next dependency pass.
- **W1, W2, W3, W6, W7** carry forward unchanged.

## 9. 2026-09-10 21:40 CEST — v2.0.5 promoted to production

Post-release check after promoting `v2.0.5-dev.2` to **v2.0.5**. Verdict: **green.** The first
`release.sh 2` run failed at the tag push (`! [remote rejected] v2.0.5 -> v2.0.5 (failed)`, no
reason from GitHub) after `main` had already been pushed; the rollback removed the tags but left
MCProxy `origin/main` one merge commit ahead of `development` and the webapp's local `main`
seven commits ahead of its remote. Repaired by merging `main` back into `development` (MCProxy)
and resetting the never-pushed local `main` (webapp); an annotated probe tag then pushed fine,
so the rejection was transient. The second run went through cleanly.

Deployed with the copied bootstrap pinned to `--tag v2.0.5` (the browser extension was not
connected, and the shell `POST /api/update/start` was classifier-blocked); same path the
update runner executes.

| Schema                          | `LATEST_SCHEMA_VERSION = 30`, no migration in this release |
| Health check                    | 15 `[OK]`                                                  |
| Tracebacks after restart        | 0                                                          |
| Repos after `post_release_prep` | both `unpushed 0`, `behind_main 0`; next dev 2.0.6         |

Watch points **W9** (CI disabled in both repos) and **W10** (`@lucide/vue` pin) carry from §8.
A full `/ai-ops` sweep is still owed once the box has settled.

## 10. 2026-09-11 00:45 CEST — slot activation verified live (v2.0.6-dev.1)

**Trigger.** The Update page's Rollback button had never been pressed. Reading
`scripts/update-runner.py` before pressing it showed that rollback overwrote
`/var/lib/mcapp/messages.db` with `meta/slot-N.db`, a snapshot taken when slot N was last
_left_ through the runner. The three deploys of 2026-09-10 went through `mcapp.sh`, which never
refreshes it, so the snapshots on the box were: slot-1 2026-09-06 15:45 UTC (schema 30), slot-0
2026-09-06 08:36 UTC (schema 29), slot-2 2026-08-22 16:06 UTC (schema 25). Pressing Rollback would
have replaced a database whose newest row was 2026-09-10 19:27 UTC with the 6 September copy. It
also never re-installed the served webapp bundle and never restarted `mcapp-ble`. Replaced by
per-slot activation (MCProxy c817bfa, webapp f35d571), shipped as v2.0.6-dev.1 into slot-0.

**Verification.** `scripts/slot_activation_sweep.sh mcapp.local`, second run (the first run
had three instrument bugs, fixed in c6b6551):

| Step                            | Result                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| activate active slot / slot 7   | 400 both                                                                                |
| slot-0 → slot-1 (v2.0.5-dev.2)  | runner success 23 s; symlink, API v2.0.5, bundle dev.2, 3 services, mcapp-ble restarted |
| slot-1 → slot-0 (manual runner) | success; API v2.0.6, bundle v2.0.6-dev.1                                                |
| slot-0 → slot-2 (v2.0.5)        | runner success 30 s; API v2.0.5, bundle v2.0.5                                          |
| slot-2 → slot-0 (manual runner) | success                                                                                 |
| database                        | schema 30 throughout; 7-day fingerprint identical across all four switches              |
| leftovers                       | no `webapp.old` / `webapp.new`, runner exit 0 every time                                |

A targeted re-check afterwards (fingerprint at t0, t0+90 s, on slot-1, on slot-1 +60 s, back on
slot-0) lost exactly one fresh row during the 90 s of ordinary running _before_ any switch and
none across the switches: normal ingest churn on the newest rows, not activation.

**Caveats for the operator.** Slots older than v2.0.6-dev.1 (currently slot-1 and slot-2) carry a
runner without `activate` and a backend without `/api/update/activate` (404). From such a slot,
return with the new slot's runner directly:

```bash
sudo ~/mcapp-slots/slot-0/.venv/bin/python3 ~/mcapp-slots/slot-0/scripts/update-runner.py --mode activate --slot 0
```

Do not press the old Rollback button while an old slot is active. The `/api/status` version is
`v<pyproject version>` (v2.0.5 on a v2.0.5-dev.2 slot); `webapp/version.html` carries the tag.

**State after the sweep.** slot-0 v2.0.6-dev.1 active, slot-1 v2.0.5-dev.2, slot-2 v2.0.5;
services active, NRestarts 0 on the new unit start, schema 30.
