# McApp BLE Service

Standalone BLE service that exposes MeshCom BLE device functionality via HTTP REST API and Server-Sent Events (SSE).

## Purpose

This service enables the McApp "brain" to run on hardware without Bluetooth support (e.g., Mac, cloud server, OrbStack VM) while the BLE service runs on a Raspberry Pi with Bluetooth hardware.

## Quick Start

### On Raspberry Pi (with Bluetooth)

```bash
cd ~/mcapp/ble_service
uv sync

export BLE_SERVICE_API_KEY=your-secret-key
uv run uvicorn ble_service.src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8081
```

### As systemd service

The service file runs as non-root user, binds to `127.0.0.1:8081`, and automatically unblocks Bluetooth radio and powers on the adapter before starting.

```bash
# Copy service file
sudo cp mcapp-ble.service /etc/systemd/system/

# Set API key
sudo systemctl edit mcapp-ble
# Add: Environment=BLE_SERVICE_API_KEY=your-secret-key

# Enable and start
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now mcapp-ble
```

## Authentication

API key is passed via the `X-API-Key` header. Behavior depends on the `BLE_SERVICE_API_KEY` environment variable:

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `"your-secret-key"` | All API endpoints require matching `X-API-Key` header |
| `""` (empty/unset) | Unauthenticated mode (startup warning logged) |
| `"disabled"` | Explicitly disable authentication (no warning) |

The `/health` endpoint never requires authentication.

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: your-secret-key" http://pi.local:8081/api/ble/status
```

## API Endpoints

### Health Check

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/health` | No | Health check |

Response:
```json
{"status": "healthy", "ble_connected": false, "timestamp": 1706100000000}
```

### Status & Discovery

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/ble/status` | Connection status, state, device info, last activity |
| GET | `/api/ble/devices` | Scan for BLE devices |

**`GET /api/ble/devices`** query parameters:

| Param | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `timeout` | 5.0 | Scan duration in seconds (1.0-30.0) |
| `prefix` | `MC-` | Device name prefix filter |

Cannot scan while connected (returns 409).

### Connection Management

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/ble/connect` | Connect to device |
| POST | `/api/ble/disconnect` | Disconnect (also resets ERROR state) |
| POST | `/api/ble/pair` | Pair with device (must be disconnected) |
| POST | `/api/ble/unpair` | Remove pairing |

**`POST /api/ble/connect`** accepts JSON body with either `device_address` (MAC) or `device_name`. If only `device_name` is given, the service scans for 5 seconds to resolve the MAC address (returns 404 if not found).

On successful connect, the service automatically: starts notifications, sends hello, waits 1s, then queries extended registers (`--io`, `--tel`).

**`POST /api/ble/disconnect`** cancels any pending auto-reconnect attempt.

**`POST /api/ble/pair`** and **`POST /api/ble/unpair`** require `device_address` in the JSON body.

### Communication

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/ble/send` | Send data to device |
| POST | `/api/ble/settime` | Sync device clock to current time |
| GET | `/api/ble/notifications` | SSE notification stream |

**`POST /api/ble/send`** supports four mutually-exclusive input modes (priority order):

| Field(s) | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `command` | Device command (0xA0) | `{"command": "--pos"}` |
| `message` + `group` | Mesh message to group | `{"message": "Hello!", "group": "20"}` |
| `data_base64` | Raw bytes (base64) | `{"data_base64": "BBAQMA=="}` |
| `data_hex` | Raw bytes (hex) | `{"data_hex": "04102030"}` |

**`POST /api/ble/settime`** sends the current Unix timestamp to the device. No request body needed.

### Device Configuration

All config endpoints require an active BLE connection (409 if not connected). Changes are **not persisted** until `config/save` is called.

| Method | Endpoint | Params | Description |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/ble/config/callsign` | `callsign` (1-15 chars) | Set node callsign |
| POST | `/api/ble/config/wifi` | `ssid` (1-32 chars), `password` (0-63 chars) | Set WiFi credentials |
| POST | `/api/ble/config/position` | `lat` (-90..90), `lon` (-180..180), `alt` (-1000..10000), `save` (bool, default false) | Set GPS position |
| POST | `/api/ble/config/aprs` | `primary` (1 char), `secondary` (1 char) | Set APRS symbol |
| POST | `/api/ble/config/save` | none | Save to flash and **reboot device** |

Parameters are passed as query parameters.

**Warning:** `config/save` reboots the device immediately and disconnects BLE. `config/position` sends three separate BLE writes (lat, lon, alt) with 200ms delays between them.

```bash
# Set callsign
curl -X POST -H "X-API-Key: secret" \
  "http://pi.local:8081/api/ble/config/callsign?callsign=DL4GLE-10"

# Set position
curl -X POST -H "X-API-Key: secret" \
  "http://pi.local:8081/api/ble/config/position?lat=48.1234&lon=11.5678&alt=520"

# Save and reboot
curl -X POST -H "X-API-Key: secret" \
  http://pi.local:8081/api/ble/config/save
```

### SSE Notification Stream

Connect to `GET /api/ble/notifications` for real-time BLE data.

**Event types:**

| Event | When | Data |
|-------|------|------|
| `status` | On initial SSE connection | `{"connected": bool, "state": "...", "timestamp": ms}` |
| `notification` | BLE data received | See formats below |
| `ping` | Every 30s if idle | `{"timestamp": ms}` |

**Notification formats:**

All notifications include `timestamp`, `raw_base64`, and `raw_hex`. The `format` field indicates how the data was decoded:

- **`json`** — Data starting with `D{`. The `parsed` field contains the decoded JSON (e.g., `{"TYP": "MH", "CALL": "OE5HWN-12"}`).
- **`binary`** — Data starting with `@`. Includes `prefix` (first 2 bytes as ASCII) and `fcs_ok` (CRC16-CCITT validation result). Bad checksums are logged but the notification is still delivered.
- **`unknown`** / **`raw`** — Anything else, or if decoding fails.

```bash
curl -N -H "X-API-Key: secret" \
  http://pi.local:8081/api/ble/notifications
```

## Connection Behavior

### Auto-Reconnect

On unexpected disconnect (detected during a failed write), the service automatically attempts to reconnect with exponential backoff: 5s, 10s, 20s, 60s (4 attempts). Auto-reconnect is cancelled if the user explicitly calls `/api/ble/disconnect`.

### Keepalive

While connected, the service sends a `--pos` command every 5 minutes to prevent the device from entering sleep mode.

### Extended Register Queries

After connecting, the service automatically queries `--io` (GPIO status) and `--tel` (telemetry config). The device auto-sends all other registers on BLE connect: I, SN, G, SA, SE+S1, SW+S2, W, AN.

### Connection States

The `state` field in status responses reflects the current connection lifecycle:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `disconnected` | No active connection |
| `connecting` | Connection attempt in progress |
| `connected` | Active connection to device |
| `disconnecting` | Disconnect in progress |
| `error` | Connection failed (cleared by calling disconnect) |

## Error Codes

| Code | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| 200 | Success | Request completed |
| 400 | Bad Request | Callsign too long, missing parameters |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Invalid or missing API key |
| 404 | Not Found | Device name not found during connect scan |
| 409 | Conflict | Not connected, already connected, scan while connected, operation in progress |
| 500 | Internal Error | BLE adapter or D-Bus failure |

## Examples

### Scan for devices

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: secret" \
  "http://pi.local:8081/api/ble/devices?timeout=10&prefix=MC-"
```

### Connect to device

```bash
# By MAC address
curl -X POST -H "X-API-Key: secret" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"device_address": "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"}' \
  http://pi.local:8081/api/ble/connect

# By name (auto-scans to resolve MAC)
curl -X POST -H "X-API-Key: secret" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"device_name": "MC-ABCDEF"}' \
  http://pi.local:8081/api/ble/connect
```

### Send message

```bash
curl -X POST -H "X-API-Key: secret" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello Mesh!", "group": "20"}' \
  http://pi.local:8081/api/ble/send
```

### Send device command

```bash
curl -X POST -H "X-API-Key: secret" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"command": "--pos"}' \
  http://pi.local:8081/api/ble/send
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `BLE_SERVICE_API_KEY` | `""` (empty) | API key. Empty = unauthenticated. `"disabled"` = explicitly no auth |
| `BLE_SERVICE_PORT` | `8081` | Server port (only when running via `__main__`) |
| `BLE_SERVICE_CORS_ORIGINS` | `*` | Comma-separated allowed CORS origins |

## Security Notes

- Always use a strong, unique API key in production
- The systemd service binds to `127.0.0.1` only — use a reverse proxy for remote access
- Consider using HTTPS via Caddy or similar reverse proxy
- Limit CORS origins in production
- The service requires D-Bus access to BlueZ
