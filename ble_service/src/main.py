# whether the node was connected.
# ⚠ INVARIANT, pinned by scripts/ble_service_tests.py — this deadline plus
# ENSURE_CONNECTED_DEADLINE_S must stay strictly under the client's
# CONNECT_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_S, i.e. 28 + 8 = 36 < 40, leaving ~4s for
# HTTP/network overhead. A timeout here

         enforced in `addBLEComToOutBuffer`, `loop_functions.cpp:606-611`,
         244 usable chars of a 245-byte cap, 247 bytes including the
         length/type header) cutting a register JSON payload it tried to
         send whole -- a live GCB0..GCB5-full `I` register still overflows

         is NOT an ATT MTU issue -- the clamp binds before the frame ever
         reaches the GATT layer, well under either platform's negotiated
         MTU.

         firmware/decoding bug, not a clamp/size problem), and this returns
         False so the caller drops the frame instead of forwarding it.

    Case 2 is the only one where a value reaching `notification["parsed"]`

    response body. Mirrored (not imported -- ble_service and mcapp are
    separate processes) into `src/mcapp/ble_client_remote.py`'s
    `ensure_connected()`, which forwards this string unchanged to the
