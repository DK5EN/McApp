"""
BLE Adapter - D-Bus/BlueZ interface for BLE device communication.

This module provides a clean async interface to BlueZ via D-Bus,
handling device discovery, connection, GATT operations, and notifications.

Multi-Part Responses:
    Some MeshCom commands send MULTIPLE JSON notifications in sequence:
    - --seset sends TYP:SE followed by TYP:S1 (sensor settings, ~200ms apart)
    - --wifiset sends TYP:SW followed by TYP:S2 (WiFi settings, ~200ms apart)

    These are separate BLE notifications, not a single message. The
    notification callback will be invoked twice for each command.

Supported Message Types:
    0x10: Hello/Wakeup (send_hello)
    0x20: Time Sync (set_time)
    0x50: Set Callsign (set_callsign)
    0x55: WiFi Settings (set_wifi)
    0x70: Set Latitude (set_latitude)
    0x80: Set Longitude (set_longitude)
    0x90: Set Altitude (set_altitude)
    0x95: APRS Symbols (set_aprs_symbols)
    0xA0: Text Commands (send_command, send_message)
    0xF0: Save & Reboot (save_and_reboot)

Extended Register Queries:
    The query_extended_registers() method queries registers NOT auto-sent
    by the device on connection:
    - --io: GPIO status (IO)
    - --tel: Telemetry config (TM)

    The device auto-sends all other registers (I, SN, G, SA, SE+S1,
    SW+S2, W, AN) on BLE connect.

        any one failing means "do nothing"):

        (b) `user_initiated` is True -- never from `_auto_reconnect` or

            destroy a bond with nobody watching. Checked first because it is
            the cheapest gate and the one every other check is pointless
            without.
        (e) `error` is not a plain timeout (`_is_plain_timeout`) -- an
            out-of-range or powered-off device dies as `TimeoutError` too,
            and that must never look like a stale bond.
        (d) `error` carries one of the conservative, explicitly-enumerated
            `_STALE_BOND_ERROR_NAMES` (`_is_recoverable_stale_bond_signature`).
            The taxonomy is not yet measured on the real target, so an
            UNRECOGNISED signature is the common case and must default to
            NOT recovering -- a false negative just leaves today's behaviour
            (a failed connect); a false positive destroys a bond.
        (a) `Paired` reads True LIVE from BlueZ right now (`_read_paired_
            live`) -- checked last, immediately before the destructive step,
            so the read is as fresh as possible and not stale by the time it
            gates `RemoveDevice`. The load-bearing gate: a device that never
            bonded cannot have a stale bond.

        (c) At most once: this method is called from exactly ONE place in
            `ensure_connected` (never in a loop, never re-entered), and does
            not call itself -- the post-recovery reconnect's own failure is
            handled inline below, not by recursing back into this method. A
            second stale-bond failure from the SAME `ensure_connected()` call
            is therefore structurally impossible, not just unlikely.
        (f) The sequence, once every gate passes, is exactly `RemoveDevice`
            (`_remove_device_unlocked`) -> discovery (`_scan_unlocked`) ->
            one connect attempt (`_connect_stage`) -- never a bare retry:
            `RemoveDevice` deletes the D-Bus object, so a retry without a
            scan in between is guaranteed to fail with
            `InterfaceNotFoundError`.
        (g) A bond that is actually destroyed is logged at WARNING,
            activity-log grade, recording the triggering error signature.
        (h) If the post-recovery connect ALSO fails, the returned exception
            (`BondRecoveryReconnectError`) says the pairing was reset and
            the device may need to be re-paired, possibly with a PIN --
            not the generic connect-failure text: the world genuinely
            changed for the user, unlike an ordinary failed connect.

        Returns None if recovery was not attempted or was not needed
        (`error` should be reported to the caller as-is), or if recovery

        connect had succeeded -- `_connect_stage` already ran

        shared by every caller:
          - A `Paired` pre-check skips a redundant `Pair()` call entirely.
          - `org.bluez.Error.AlreadyExists` from `Pair()` counts as success,
            not failure -- re-pairing an already-working device used to look
            identical to a real pairing failure (one blanket `except`).

        Returns `(True, None)` on success (including both cases above),
        `(False, exception)` on a genuine failure.
