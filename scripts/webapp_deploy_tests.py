"""Startup regression suite for the webapp deploy path.

Guards two defects found by diffing mcapp.local's serve directory against the
v2.0.1 release artifact.

**1. The deploy overlaid instead of replacing.** Both callers ran
``cp -a src/. "$WEBAPP_DIR/"``, which writes the new build on top of the old and
removes nothing. Vite emits content-hashed filenames, so nothing is ever
overwritten and every release left its whole predecessor behind: **868 files
served where the release contains 70** — 26 MB, 721 files in ``assets/`` alone.
The leftovers are inert, because nothing references them, which is exactly why
this went unnoticed through every release to date.

**2. macOS AppleDouble sidecars.** 133 ``._*`` files had reached the serve
directory. They are created by *macOS tar*, which emits a ``._<name>`` member for
any file carrying extended attributes — so they were manufactured during the
release build, not copied out of ``dist/``. ``release.sh`` now sets
``COPYFILE_DISABLE=1`` (plus an ``--exclude``), and the deploy strips any that
survive by another route.

The replace is staged and swapped by two renames in one filesystem, so the two
failure modes that matter are pinned too: a failed copy must leave the live tree
untouched, and a failed install must restore it.

**3. An unchecked chown/chmod fell through to the swap.** Commit ``35c79f6``
found that ``chown -R www-data:www-data "$staging"`` and ``chmod -R 755
"$staging"`` were unchecked, and both call sites invoke
``install_webapp_tree`` as ``... || return 1`` / ``if ! ...`` — which
disables errexit for the WHOLE function body, not just the guarded command —
so a failing chown or chmod used to reach the two ``mv``s and activate a
staged tree nobody had actually chowned/chmodded. Every step is now checked
by hand; this suite pins both failures directly by making them actually fail.

Like ``caddy_config_tests.py`` this sources the real shell file via subprocess
rather than reimplementing its logic — ``deploy.sh`` sources cleanly standalone
(no ``readonly`` declarations, no top-level statements), so the whole file is
loaded instead of extracting one function by regex; a rename or reflow that a
regex would silently stop matching cannot go unnoticed this way.
``chown``/``chmod`` are stubbed on PATH because the function targets
``www-data`` and the suite does not run as root — stubbing keeps the
production code strict instead of loosening it for the test.
