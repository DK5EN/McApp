"""Startup regression suite for ``release.sh``'s ``post_release_prep``.

Guards the fix for the bug that **blocked the v2.0.1 production release**.

``post_release_prep`` is the last step of a production release: it bumps the
version for the next dev cycle and pushes. It bumped and pushed **MCProxy only**.
The webapp got neither — so:

1. ``package.json`` stayed at the previous release's version forever, and
2. far worse, the ``main -> development`` merge that ``merge_main_back`` had
   just committed in the webapp was never pushed. That leaves webapp
   ``origin/main`` one commit ahead of ``origin/development``, which is exactly
   the diverged state ``validate_main_mergeable`` aborts on — so the failure
   surfaced one release later, at the *start* of the next cut, with an error
   message pointing at the webapp rather than at the release that caused it.

Three invariants are pinned:

1. **Both repos are bumped.** A repo that carries a version must have it moved.
2. **Both repos are pushed.** This is the actual regression: the assertion is
   made against the *remote*, not the working tree, because the pre-fix code
   committed in the webapp and simply never pushed — a working-tree assertion
   would have passed while the bug was live.
3. **The webapp bump tolerates an already-correct version.** ``npm version``
   exits non-zero with "Version not changed" when asked for the version the file
   already holds, which under ``set -e`` takes the whole release down. This is
   not hypothetical: the two repos were out of step for the entire v2.0.0 ->
   v2.0.1 cycle (``package.json`` sat at 2.0.0 while ``pyproject.toml`` moved),
   so bringing the webapp into line by hand is exactly what a release then walks
   into. The guard must skip the bump and still push.

   Note this is *not* a claim that ``post_release_prep`` as a whole is
   re-runnable — the MCProxy half commits unconditionally and would abort on an
   empty commit. It runs once per release, and the trap rolls the release back
   on any failure.

Like ``caddy_config_tests.py`` and ``update_runner_tests.py`` this exercises
shell code rather than an importable module, so it drives the real function via
subprocess instead of copying its logic — a copy would drift from what ships.
The function is extracted from ``release.sh`` by name; a rename fails the
extraction loudly rather than silently testing nothing.

``npm`` is stubbed. What is under test is release.sh's control flow — that it
invokes the bump in the right directory and pushes afterwards — not npm's own
correctness. The stub records its argv so the invocation itself is asserted.
