"""Startup test suite for `ble_service` — the FastAPI process that has zero
other coverage anywhere in the repo (the gated runner's `ble_protocol` suite
tests `mcapp/ble_protocol.py`, a different module entirely).

The suite started out covering only persisted BLE state. The bug that made
that necessary: `ble_state.json` recorded `"device_name": null`. The webapp's
connect request sends only `device_address`, so the persisted name was always
None. That was fixed by falling back to the name BlueZ resolved... but only
in the `/api/ble/connect` route, which was `_save_ble_state`'s ONLY caller.
Every service restart auto-reconnects from the saved MAC *without* going
through that route, so the null was reloaded and re-persisted forever.
Observed live on mcapp.local after the 2026-07-31 deploy:

    Loaded BLE state: AC:A7:04:06:B8:79 (None)
    Startup auto-connect successful to AC:A7:04:06:B8:79

while `/api/ble/status` correctly reported "MC-b878-DK5EN-98" the whole time.
A code review missed it; a test would not have.

Coverage was later extended to the rest of the module's load-bearing
surfaces: the `_api_key_valid` auth boundary (both as a unit and through
`TestClient` at the HTTP layer), `/api/ble/status`'s payload shape (pinned
against what `src/mcapp/ble_client_remote.py`'s `refresh_status()` actually
parses), `PATCH /api/ble/pin`'s range validation, and `_retry_connect` — the
shared backoff loop behind both auto-reconnect and startup auto-connect.

(A `crc16_ccitt` wire-frame checksum used to be covered here too. It was
removed along with the `fcs_ok` notification field it backed:
`ble_service/src/main.py` ran CRC-16/CCITT over the wrong byte range at the
wrong offset -- comparing a CRC against the timestamp MSB and pad, not the
actual frame FCS -- so it was False on essentially every real frame and had
zero consumers repo-wide. See the 2026-08-21 wire audit, finding L5.)

That extension turned up a second family of bugs, all now fixed in
`ble_service/src/main.py` and pinned here: the state-file readers guarded
themselves with narrow exception tuples while being called from paths that
cannot tolerate a raise. `_load_ble_pin()` in particular runs inside
`lifespan()` BEFORE the yield, so any escape stops the BLE service starting
at all. See `_test_ble_state_missing_corrupt_and_nondict` (the reader
contract) and `_test_ble_pin_persistence` (the writer that silently dropped
the PIN over a non-dict file). Every assertion in this suite is expected to
pass; a red one is a real regression, never an "expected" failure.

Convention matches the other `*_tests.py` suites: a `run_*_tests()` returning
a bool, printing gated on `has_console`, wired into `run_startup_tests.py`.

Offline, TTY-free and deterministic:

  - **Never touches the real /var/lib/mcapp.** Every test redirects
    `BLE_STATE_FILE` into a `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()` first and restores
    it in a `finally` — including the `_retry_connect` tests whose stubs make
    the persisting branch unreachable *today*, because "unreachable" is one
    stub edit away from writing to production state.
  - **Never depends on the ambient environment.** `ble_main.API_KEY` is read
    from `BLE_SERVICE_API_KEY` at import time and is set for real on the Pi
    (`mcapp-ble.service`), so every test that speaks HTTP pins it explicitly
    rather than inheriting whatever the shell has exported.
  - **Never leaks between tests.** `ble_main.state` is one shared singleton;
    scalars go through `_snapshot_state`/`_restore_state` and the append-only
    side channels through `_snapshot_side_effects`, so suite order does not
    matter and two runs in one process produce identical results.
  - **Never sleeps or touches BlueZ.** `_retry_connect` is driven with tiny
    all-zero `delays` tuples (the parameter exists for exactly this) and a
    stubbed `_connect_and_initialize`; `TestClient` is deliberately used
    *without* a `with` block so ASGI lifespan — and therefore real adapter
    construction and the auto-connect task — never runs.

    (`BLE_JSON_PAYLOAD_MAX`, `configuration_global.h`; enforced in
    `addBLEComToOutBuffer`, `loop_functions.cpp:606-611`) -- exactly what
    MeshCom FW 4.36's proposed filter-list register field risks, and what a
    node with all six `GCB0..GCB5` slots populated already hits on `I` --
    must not vanish behind only a DEBUG-level trace. This specific frame is
    cut inside its very FIRST member's value (no closing quote), so no
    complete top-level member survives at all and
    `_repair_truncated_json_object` correctly declines -- the case where
    salvage is genuinely impossible, exercised separately from
    `_test_notification_callback_truncated_frame_is_salvaged_not_dropped`
    below (most real-world truncations, cut near the 244-char mark, DO have
    several complete members before the cut and get salvaged, not dropped).
    For this genuinely unsalvageable case it must:
      (a) be logged at a level that is actually seen (WARNING or higher,
          never DEBUG);
      (b) name BOTH that it looks truncated AND that the update was
          dropped, so the failure is diagnosable, not just noted;
      (c) never be reported as a successful 'json' parse (no silent partial
          apply of a half-arrived register update);
      (d) be genuinely discarded -- NOT enqueued for SSE delivery at all.
          "Discarded" used to mean "logged but still forwarded as
          format: raw", which was pure noise on the wire dressed up as
          forwarding; this is the real fix.

    Proved discriminating: reverting `_decode_register_frame` to the old
    bare `json.loads(json_str)` (no try/except, no `_json_frame_looks_
    truncated` call, no bool return) makes this raise straight out of
    `notification_callback`'s inner try into its own generic `except
    Exception as e: logger.warning("Notification decode error: %s", e)`
    fallback -- which still logs at WARNING but with no truncation
    diagnosis or length information (failing assertion (b)), and which
    still enqueues the notification (failing assertion (d), since that
    fallback path does not `return` early). Verified by hand during
    development (edit in place, run, revert) per the no-git-stash brief
    constraint; not left as a permanent mutant in this file.

    The threat model is explicit and mundane: a Pi's SD card gets yanked
    mid-write or remounts read-only, or an operator/script drops the wrong file
    in place. What made it severe is *where* these run —

      - `_load_ble_pin()` is called directly, UNGUARDED, from `lifespan()` on
        every startup (`state.ble_pin = _load_ble_pin() or _BLE_PIN_ENV`,
        BEFORE the `yield`). Anything escaping it raises straight out of ASGI
        startup and the BLE service never comes up at all.
      - `_load_ble_state()` is called the same way from `_startup_auto_connect`,
        which runs as an `asyncio.create_task()` — there an escape is merely an
        unretrieved task exception (logged by asyncio's default handler), so it
        silently kills auto-connect instead of the whole app.

    Three separate rounds of narrow `except (...)` tuples missed a shape here,
    which is why `_read_ble_state_file` now catches `Exception` outright and
    this test is table-driven over `_CORRUPT_STATE_SHAPES` rather than over
    whichever shapes someone thought of. `_load_ble_pin` keeps an enumerated
    tuple only because its residual risk is exactly `int()` on a JSON scalar,
    whose failure domain (TypeError/ValueError/OverflowError) is closed.

    Also pins the MAC's *type*, not just its truthiness: `_load_ble_state`'s
    return feeds straight into `adapter.connect(mac)`, so a non-str
    `device_mac` must read as "no saved state", not be passed down to D-Bus.

    `reconnecting` (bool), `state` (str) and `error` (str | None) straight off
    this JSON body with `.get()` — a silently renamed or retyped field there
    breaks the proxy with no error on either side.

    no BlueZ.

    Records every call in order (`self.calls`). `call_*`/`get_*`/`set_*`

    (un)subscriptions are sync no-ops (matching `dbus_next`'s signal API --
    these tests never need a notification to actually fire).

    `call_get(iface, prop)` (Properties.Get) is special-cased to read

    names against the same interface (Connected/ServicesResolved/Name,

    `hangs` holds method names that never return -- modelling a wedged
    bluetoothd. dbus_next has no reply timeout of its own, so an un-timed call
    really would block forever; a test can only tell "this call has a timeout"

    `result`: the `EnsureConnectedResult` `ensure_connected()` returns.

          `send_hello()` is awaited -- the firmware's "reject a wrong PIN"
          behaviour the pin_required probe exists to catch.

          real adapter's `write()` raises `RuntimeError("Not connected")` when
          the GATT write interface has been cleared while the status still says
          CONNECTED. Proves the route clears its pin-probe/init markers in a
          `finally`, not just on the paths that return normally.
        - `"registers_hang"`: `query_extended_registers()` never returns --
          paired with a shrunk `POST_CONNECT_INIT_DEADLINE_S` to exercise the
          post-connect init's own deadline.

    `post_connect_init_during_hello` records `state.post_connect_init` as
