"""Pure parser for the per-hop signal-report chain in a MeshCom HEY beacon's
`PP` field (BLE `TYP: "MH"` register, `payload_type == '@'`).

`PP` (along with `SRC`/`GW`) was reverted upstream 2026-08-28 (`dc7d56d7`,
`17d1796e`) and the current `MH` register no longer carries it. This parser
is retained anyway: it stays correct against older firmware still in the
field, and is ready to be exercised again without rewriting it if `PP` is
re-adopted upstream.

Wire format, verbatim from firmware (do not re-derive — these citations are
the source of truth):

    R<ncnt>;                  written by the originating station: its own
                               neighbour count (`sendHey()`, loop_functions.cpp:4242)
    <ncnt>,<rssi>,<snr>;      appended by each relay, one group per hop, in
                               transmission order (`appendHeySignalReport()`,
                               aprs_functions.cpp:1127)

Example: `R12;8,101,-7;15,95,5;`

Five deliberate firmware behaviours a naive parser gets wrong, all honoured
here:

1. **RSSI is a POSITIVE MAGNITUDE on the wire.** `appendHeySignalReport()`
   emits `String(rssi*-1.0, 0)` — `-101 dBm` appears as `101`. `HeyHop.rssi`
   is the NEGATED value (real dBm); trusting the wire sign inverts every
   reading in a way that still looks physically plausible. This is the
   single most important thing this module gets right.
2. **Legacy-format detection is by COMMA COUNT in the leading token, not by
   field count** (`mheard_functions.cpp:436-451`): the firmware counts the
   commas between `R` and the first `;`. **0 commas** (`R99;`) and
   **2 commas** (`R99,99,99;`) are both valid; **1 comma** (`R99,99;`) is
   INVALID and rejected — that is the firmware's own rule, not an inferred
   one.
3. In the 2-comma legacy shape, the firmware keeps only the leading integer
   as the neighbour count and DISCARDS the other two values. This module
   mirrors that: `HeyChain.legacy` records that the shape was seen, and the
   two discarded values never become a `HeyHop` (nor are they validated —
   they are thrown away exactly as the firmware throws them away).
4. **The chain stops before our own hop.** It describes the path up to and
   including the last relay; the link from that last relay to us is carried
   in the MH register's own top-level `RSSI`/`SNR` fields, not in `PP`.
   Callers must not double-count: appending the MH register's own
   RSSI/SNR as an implicit final hop is a caller error, not something this
   module does for you.
5. **The chain carries no callsigns.** The result is an ordered list of
   `(ncnt, rssi, snr)` and nothing that identifies which station each hop
   was. A caller can say at which POSITION in the path a link was weak,
   never which station — do not attribute a hop to any callsign.

Two more facts about how this field arrives in practice (both new as of
firmware 2026-08-28), neither of which this module can or should work
around:

* The firmware caps the on-air chain at `HEY_PATH_PAYLOAD_MAX` = 106 chars;
  `appendHeySignalReport()` returns early instead of appending a group that
  would exceed it. So a real chain can legitimately be SHORTER than
  `origin_ncnt` implies, and on the wire it always ends cleanly at a group
  boundary — but this parser does not rely on that guarantee for its own
  correctness, since the input is unauthenticated.
* The firmware drops the whole `PP` field from the MH register when the
  register's JSON would exceed 244 chars, which starts happening from
  roughly 5 relay hops onward. So an ABSENT `PP` field means nothing about
  the real hop count — callers must not read "no chain" as "no relays".
  Handling that absence is the caller's problem; this module only parses
  the string when one is present.

**Out-of-range values (e.g. `abs(rssi) > 200`, `abs(snr) > 60`) are kept,
not rejected.** This is a decode layer, not a validity gate: MCProxy's
storage ingest already range-guards signal values before persisting them
(`VALID_RSSI_RANGE` / `VALID_SNR_RANGE` in `src/mcapp/storage/constants.py`).
Adding a second, differently-tuned range check here would only create a
second place that can disagree with the first — a physically absurd
`HeyHop` is a valid parse of the string, and it is up to a caller that
persists or displays it to apply whichever range policy is authoritative
there.

No I/O, no storage, no global state: `parse_hey_chain()` only turns a `PP`
string into a `HeyChain` or `None`. This decodes data taken straight off an
unauthenticated RF link, so it must never raise for any input, however
malformed, hostile, or pathologically large, and the work it does is bounded
regardless of input size (see `_MAX_PAYLOAD_LEN`).
