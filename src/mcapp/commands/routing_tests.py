"""Extracted test suite for RoutingMixin's response-target resolution and error mapping.

Covers ``_resolve_response_target`` and ``_error_response_text``, which previously had
no direct tests — they were only exercised indirectly through the
``_should_execute_command`` scenarios in ``commands/tests.py``. Both functions are pure
(no I/O, no storage), so this suite is fully hermetic: a minimal stub exposing only the
``my_callsign`` attribute stands in for the full ``CommandHandler``.

Also covers two regressions driven end-to-end through the REAL ``_message_handler``:

- Bug A: an own command sent to a broadcast destination (``*``/``ALL``/empty) must
  reply local-only (SSE/websocket only), never over BLE/UDP — while an own command
  to a VALID group must keep transmitting its reply (production-verified: a
  ``!wx`` in group 20 went out on air; that must never regress).
- Bug C: ``!help`` must be derived from the COMMANDS registry so it cannot drift.
