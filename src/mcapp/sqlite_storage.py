"""
SQLite storage backend for McApp.

Provides persistent message storage as an alternative to in-memory deque.
Uses Python's built-in sqlite3 with asyncio.to_thread() for async operations.

`SQLiteStorage` is assembled (ST-04) from mixins in `storage/`, each owning one
concern: `MigrationsMixin` (schema + versioned migrations), `IngestMixin`
(store_message/store_telemetry + signal-bucket accumulation), `QueryMixin`
(reporting/chart/dump reads), `PrefsMixin` (small UI-preference tables),
`ClassifierApiMixin` (classifier_rules/beacon_templates CRUD), and `UptimeMixin`
(the gateway-uptime segment ledger). This module keeps
only the core DB-access primitives (`_query`/`_mutate`/`_execute_many`),
construction/teardown, and the module-level regression test suite.
