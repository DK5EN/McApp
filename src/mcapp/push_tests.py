"""Startup regression suite for Web Push (Wave 5, PWA campaign, contract v6).

Implements every vector in `contract/push_contract.json` (a byte-verbatim copy
of the shared wire contract; the mc-chat sibling implements the SAME vectors
against its own implementation so both backends behave identically) — all
match_vectors (incl. via-routed dst resolution), all eligibility_vectors, all
blocklist_vectors, all payload_vectors, and the dedup coalesce scenario — plus
subscribe/unsubscribe/upsert, prune-on-401/403/404/410, VAPID persistence, and
an execution-isolation regression.

NEVER calls real pywebpush — every `webpush_fn` used here is an injected stub
— and NEVER generates a real VAPID keypair — `load_or_create_vapid`'s
`generator` is always injected, and `build_push_router`'s `vapid`/`dispatcher`
parameters are always supplied explicitly so router construction never
touches `/var/lib/mcapp/vapid.json` or performs real crypto. See
`push_delivery.py`'s module docstring for the testability seams this suite
exercises.

`contract/push_contract.json` is subtree-managed, with mc-chat upstream — edit it
there and re-sync (CLAUDE.md, "Vendored Subtrees"), never in place here. Until
2026-07-26 mc-chat kept it at `tests/fixtures/`, OUTSIDE the subtree prefix, so a
`git subtree pull --prefix=src/mcapp/contract` deleted the file `_CONTRACT_PATH`
points at and broke this suite together with the whole gated runner.

# v4 (2026-07-26): file moved inside mc-chat's subtree'd `contract/` prefix;
# adds eligibility clause (c) — text ACKs and {CET} broadcasts are not

# v5 (2026-08-17): adds eligibility clause (d) — firmware {ping}/{pong}
# link-check protocol frames are not push-eligible.
# v6 (2026-08-18): adds a client-side ordering clause to subscribe semantics —
# a subscribe POST replaces the stored filter wholesale, so a client must not
# send a filter its own preference store has not yet supplied, and servers must
# not try to detect that case heuristically. Normative text only; no vectors and
# no backend behavior change, so this suite is unchanged apart from the pin.

# ack-request suffix ('{NNN', no closing brace) is stripped from the
# delivered payload text, BEFORE the 120-char truncation, but the
# eligibility/blocklist/dedup gates must see the UNSTRIPPED text. Adds 5

# loop) plus a dedicated ordering regression here
