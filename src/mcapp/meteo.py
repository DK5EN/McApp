    GPS fix) and the literal `0.0/0.0` pair a disconnected/no-fix GPS module
    reports. Historically only the `None` check was applied (here and in
    `sse_routes/weather.py`/`main.py`'s `_cache_gps`), so a `0/0` position
    was treated as a real coordinate and silently fetched as weather for the
    Gulf of Guinea. Checked as a PAIR (`lat == 0 and lon == 0`), not
    individually — a real station can legitimately sit exactly on the
    equator or the prime meridian on its own; only both at once is the

    DELIBERATE TRADE-OFF, not an oversight: this makes Null Island
    unaddressable. A station genuinely at 0.0000/0.0000 — open Atlantic
    ~600 km off Ghana, i.e. a ship, and one whose GPS rounded to exactly
    four zeroed decimals in both axes at that instant — gets "waiting for
    GPS" instead of weather. That is accepted because the alternative,
    honouring 0/0, silently mislocates EVERY node whose GPS has no fix yet:
    a no-fix module reports exactly this pair, MeshCom firmware ships
    `node_lat = 0.0` as its factory default, and the whole point of this
    module's Wave 3 changes is to stop serving confidently wrong weather.

        `bypass_cache=True` is for the mesh `!wx` command (weather_command.py)
        — a ham operator asking for weather over LoRa expects a live reading,
        not a REST-poll-driven cache. REST callers (sse_routes/weather.py's
        `/api/weather` and `/api/weather/preview`) use the default cached path.

        The cache holds the FULLY ASSEMBLED response — the same dict this
        method returns, post-fusion — so a warm hit is a lock, a TTL compare
        and a dict return: no re-fusion, no age/humidity recompute, no solar
        work. Nothing in the cached dict is refreshed per call either: its
        `timestamp`/`messzeitpunkt` fields already record when the data was
        actually fetched/measured, which is correct to leave frozen for the
        TTL, and the "now"-dependent bits (`_is_daytime` -> solar altitude,
        cloud-cover text) are never stored here at all — they're computed
        on demand by `format_for_lora`/`get_verbose_report` from the stored
        fields and stay out of this cache's scope.

        Three tiers, in order of what a caller sees:
        1. **Warm** (age < TTL): the cached dict, verbatim, no work at all.
        2. **Stale, GOOD data cached** (age >= WEATHER_CACHE_TTL_S, no
           "error" key): the stale dict is returned immediately and exactly
           one background daemon thread refreshes it (`_refresh_in_flight`
           single-flights it — an overlapping caller just gets the same
           stale dict, never a second fetch). A refresh that itself fails
           does NOT clobber the good stale data with an error payload; it
           only arms `_refresh_retry_after` so the next attempt waits
           WEATHER_ERROR_CACHE_TTL_S instead of retrying on every call.
        3. **No cached data for this generation** (cold start, or the first
           call after `update_location()`/an error-cache expiry): blocks on
           `_fetch_weather_data()` synchronously, as before. An error result
           here is cached under WEATHER_ERROR_CACHE_TTL_S and, deliberately,
           is NOT promoted to stale-while-revalidate on its own expiry — with
           nothing good to show in the meantime there is no "stale" value
           worth serving early, so that case keeps the original synchronous
           refetch-on-expiry behaviour (pinned by
