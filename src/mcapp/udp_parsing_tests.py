"""Built-in test suite for the pure parsing helpers in ``udp_handler``.

Companion to ``udp_handler.run_startup_tests()`` (which only covers the listen
loop's exception recovery and signal writing). This suite exercises the
standalone parsing helpers that had no coverage before:

* ``try_repair_json`` — bounded malformed-JSON repair (CO-08 cap).
* ``decode_and_filter`` (``mcapp.text_decode``) — the inbound charset policy:
  UTF-8 with a per-byte CP1252 fallback, then a narrow unsafe-codepoint filter.
* ``_normalize_altitude_to_meters`` — APRS feet → meters conversion.
* ``_undouble_aprs_symbol_escapes`` — the MeshCom firmware's double-escaped
  backslash on the alternate APRS symbol table (see ``aprs-escape-bug.md``),
  both as a unit and end-to-end through ``_process_received_message``.
* ``_unescape_firmware_msg_body`` — the SAME firmware double-escape, one field
  over: ``sendExtern()`` runs a text message's body through ``strEsc()`` before
  ArduinoJson escapes it again, so a user's quotes reached the UI with a stray
  backslash in front of each. Also covered as a unit and end-to-end. The two
  normalizers pull in opposite directions on the same character, which is why
  both carry ``type``-scoped cases: a ``pos`` payload's lone backslash is a real
  APRS table id and must survive the msg-body pass untouched.
* ``_strip_non_scalar_fields`` — the container-shaped-value guard that runs at
  the same ingress choke point, again both as a unit and end-to-end.
* The ``NODE-<octet>`` pseudo-callsign derivation inside
  ``UDPHandler._process_received_message``.

``*_tests.py`` now carries the same per-file ruff relief as ``tests.py`` and
``test_*.py`` (see ``[tool.ruff.lint.per-file-ignores]``). This suite predates that
and still avoids what the relief permits: no bare ``assert`` (booleans in a results
list instead, which is what the startup runner reports on) and named constants for
magic numbers. Keep it that way — the results-list style is what makes each case
print its own PASS/FAIL label.

All timestamps in the wire format are milliseconds.
