"""Web Push REST endpoints (Wave 5, PWA campaign, contract v6): VAPID public
key, subscribe (upsert-by-endpoint), unsubscribe.

Subscribe overwrites the stored filter WHOLESALE — there is no partial update
and no merge. Contract v6 pins the consequence: ordering is the client's
obligation, and a server MUST NOT try to guess whether a default-looking filter
was deliberate. Do not add such a heuristic here; it would break clearing groups
on purpose and diverge this backend from mc-chat.

Wires `PushDispatcher` (`push_delivery.py`) into the mesh-message ingest
pipeline WITHOUT the ingest handler ever awaiting push delivery — see
`push_delivery.PushDispatcher.handle_mesh_message` and its module docstring
for the execution-isolation design this depends on.

The node's own callsign is sourced from `manager.message_router.my_callsign`
(the same field `sse_routes/prefs.py`'s delete_messages route and the
suppression logic already treat as MCProxy's single source of truth for
"who am I" — see `MessageRouter.set_callsign`), never hardcoded.

See `src/mcapp/contract/push_contract.json` for the wire contract this
implements; `push_tests.py` runs every vector in it against this
implementation.
