        The browser only ever reaches mcapp (Caddy/lighttpd proxy ^/api/ ->
        :8082) -- ble_service's own POST /api/ble/ensure_connected lives on
        :8081, which is not browser-reachable (and would be mixed-content
        blocked over TLS regardless). Same 503/502 pattern as set_ble_pin
        above: 503 when the active BLE client doesn't support this call
        (BLE-disabled mode), 502 when the forward itself fails.

        On success this also SCHEDULES the register hydration sweep that the
        legacy `connect BLE` router command used to do inline
        (`_query_ble_registers` + `_handle_ble_info_command`). The webapp
        stopped sending that command when it moved to this route, and nothing
        replaced it — which is why the frontend sat on XX0XXX / 0.0.0 /
        00:00:00:00 forever, with "G" the only register ever to appear
        (ble_service's 300 s keepalive `--pos` delivered that one by accident).

        Two properties of the call below are deliberate:

        * It is a SCHEDULE, not an await. The sweep waits out the node's
          post-hello config burst and then spaces ten commands ~1 s apart, so
          awaiting it would turn this route into a ~21 s request. The response
          shape and the 503/502 behaviour are unchanged.
        * It is gated on the BODY, not on the HTTP status. ble_service reports
          a failed connect as `success: false` with an `error_code` inside an
          HTTP 200, so "we got here without an exception" is not success —
          hydrating after a failed connect would just fire ten commands at a
          radio that is not there.
