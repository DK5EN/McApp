"""Regression suite for the BLE config-register hydration sweep.

WHAT BROKE. A MeshCom node emits its twelve config registers
(I SN G SA SE S1 SW S2 W AN IO TM) only as its own post-hello burst, exactly
once per genuine hello handshake; mcapp merely cached whatever of that burst
flew past. When the webapp moved its connect flow to
`POST /api/ble/ensure_connected`, that route queried nothing at all, so every
path without a fresh hello left the cache empty and the frontend sat on
`XX0XXX` / `0.0.0` / `00:00:00:00` forever. The fix re-requests every register
explicitly, via text commands, on a scheduled background sweep.

WHAT THIS SUITE PINS DOWN. The ten-command sequence and its exact order (the
assertion that fails against the old three-command `--pos/--io/--tel` sweep),
the mapping from those ten commands onto all twelve registers, the load-bearing
inter-command spacing, the route's success-body gating, the single-flight
SKIP semantics, the `after_hello`/`replay_grace` delay choice, the never-raises
contract of a detached task, the pre-sweep link re-check, cancellation, the
SSE-recovery hook in `ble_client_remote`, and the timeout ceiling.

WHAT `skip_if_complete` FIXES. Every "ensure populated" caller used to
schedule an unconditional sweep even when `BLEClientRemote`'s SSE-attach
register replay (`_replay_cached_registers`) had already filled the cache for
free in ~1-1.5s -- a plain mcapp-only restart ran a redundant ~9s,
10-command RF sweep for nothing. `skip_if_complete=True` makes the sweep
re-check completeness once it actually starts and no-op (logged, not silent)
if REQUIRED_BLE_REGISTER_TYPES is already satisfied; "explicit refresh"
callers (legacy `connect BLE` / `info BLE`, `POST /api/ble/ensure_connected`)
keep the default False on purpose, so a user-requested refresh never silently
does nothing.

NO HARDWARE, NO NETWORK, NO `/etc/mcapp`. The BLE client is a duck-typed
recording stub registered as the `ble_client` protocol; the HTTP route is
driven by calling its FastAPI endpoint function directly with a stubbed
manager; `BLEClientRemote` is exercised only through two pure-logic methods
that never open a socket.

NO WALL-CLOCK TIMING, EITHER. `main`'s module-level `asyncio` reference is
swapped for `_RecordingAsyncio`, which records every `await asyncio.sleep(x)`
argument and returns immediately while forwarding `create_task`, `timeout` and
everything else to the real module. That makes the delay assertions DIRECT (the
value production code passed) instead of inferred from elapsed time, and keeps
the whole suite at well under a second with the real 12 s / 1 s / 0.8 s / 1.2 s
constants left untouched. The swap and the one constant this suite does patch
(`BLE_REQUERY_TIMEOUT_S`) are restored in `finally`, because
`scripts/run_startup_tests.py` runs every suite in one process.

Exposes `run_ble_hydration_tests() -> bool`; the central orchestrator
`scripts/run_startup_tests.py` wires it in.
