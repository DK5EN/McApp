"""
BLE Client Abstraction Layer

This module provides a unified interface for BLE operations, supporting
multiple backends:
- remote: HTTP/SSE client (for remote BLE service)
- disabled: No-op stub (for testing without BLE)

For local Bluetooth hardware access, deploy the standalone BLE service
(ble_service/) on the Pi and use remote mode.

Usage:
    from ble_client import create_ble_client, BLEMode

    # Create client based on config
    client = await create_ble_client(
        mode=BLEMode.REMOTE,
        remote_url="http://pi.local:8081",
        api_key="secret"
    )

    # Use unified API
    await client.connect("AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF")
    await client.send_message("Hello!", "20")
