"""Built-in regression suite for retroactive blocklist enforcement.

Before this suite's fixes, `blocklist_decision` ran only on ingest and on the
live SSE broadcast, which made a sperrliste entry purely forward-looking:
every row a station had already deposited stayed in `messages.db` and was
replayed to every client on every reload, forever. Since the sperrliste is
curated centrally and lands on nodes we do not administer, a per-host DELETE is
not an available fix — the read path has to filter.

Cases:

  1. `MessageRouter.filter_history_row` — the shared decision, applied on the
     way OUT of storage. Pass / drop (DM) / drop (position) / redirect
     (group, broadcast, hashtag), and the no-mutation guarantee: the caller's
     dict is never rewritten in place, because storage reuses row dicts and the
     live path shares the same objects with other subscribers.
  2. `get_smart_initial_with_summary(blocklist_filter=...)` — a blocked
     station's messages, acks and positions are gone from the burst, its group
     posts reappear under SPAM_GROUP, and the SUMMARY counts agree with what
     was actually emitted (an unfiltered summary would keep advertising a
     conversation whose messages were just removed).
  3. `get_messages_page(blocklist_filter=...)` — scrolling back must not
     re-surface what the burst filtered out, and `has_more` must stay keyed on
     the RAW row count so a fully-filtered page does not read as "start of
     history" and stop the client's backwards walk.
  4. SSE burst ORDER — `blocked_callsigns` must be emitted BEFORE
     `smart_initial`. The webapp applies the set at a single ingest chokepoint,
     so anything delivered ahead of it is admitted against an empty blocklist.
     This is the ordering bug that kept a blocked station on screen even with a
     correct list on both ends.
  5. Sperrliste reconciliation (`_apply_sperrliste`) — additions union in,
     upstream REMOVALS now un-block (previously they needed a restart), a local
     admin kickban is protected from an upstream removal, and `!kb delall`
     followed by an unchanged refresh restores the curated entries.
  6. Conditional refresh — a 304 is neither a failure nor an empty list, the
     ETag is only remembered for a payload that actually validated, and the
     refresh cadence is well under the old 24 h.
