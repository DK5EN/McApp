        persistence, the historical gap that let blocked callsigns still reach
        the webapp live and trigger command responses. Returns:

            "pass"     — src not blocked; handle normally.
            "redirect" — blocked group/broadcast/hashtag traffic; the broadcast
                         path quarantines it to SPAM_GROUP (9999) for live

        `strip_relay_path` the command path applies three lines after this guard, so
        a stray-whitespace `src` can no longer slip past the blocklist and then
        normalize cleanly into command execution. `dst` classification is
        delegated to `dst_kind`, which resolves a via-routed 'VIA,TARGET' to its
        real target before deciding — so a relayed group/hashtag post from a
        blocked station is quarantined to SPAM_GROUP instead of being dropped

        The mental model this method used to be written around was wrong, and
        the `XX0XXX` / `0.0.0` / `00:00:00:00` placeholders the frontend showed
        forever are what it cost. The node does auto-send its twelve registers
        (I, SN, G, SA, SE+S1, SW+S2, W, AN, IO, TM) — but ONLY as its own
        post-hello config burst, exactly once per genuine hello handshake
        (firmware: esp32_main.cpp/nrf52_main.cpp's `config_cmds`). mcapp
        merely caches whatever of that burst happens to fly past
        (`_wire_ble_caches`). Every path that does not produce a fresh hello
        therefore leaves the cache empty or stale, and there are several:

        * an mcapp restart while `ble_service` keeps the BLE session alive —
          `BLEClientRemote.start()` sees `connected` and never redoes
          connect()/hello (see `requery_reused_ble_connection`);
        * `POST /api/ble/ensure_connected`, which returns to the webapp before
          the burst has even started and used to hydrate nothing at all;
        * an mcapp<->ble_service SSE drop, which wipes `cached_ble_registers`
          via `_clear_ble_cache_on_disconnect` while the radio link is often
          still perfectly alive, and nothing refilled it.

        So: every register IS re-requestable, and this method requests all of
        them. The mapping below is exact and was verified against firmware
        source and against a live node — the answer to `--info` on the real
        radio is a "TYP":"I" frame carrying FWVER/CALL/ID/HWID, which is
        precisely the payload the frontend renders. Re-sending the 0x10 hello
        to re-trigger the batch is NOT an option and must not be reintroduced:
        it re-runs the node's `sendMheard()` into the same ring buffer and
        re-runs PIN auth, where a wrong hash drops the link.

        Spacing is load-bearing, not politeness. Two text commands landing in
        one firmware main-loop tick means only the last one executes, so every
        command is followed by a sleep. `--seset` and `--wifiset` each answer
        with TWO frames (SE+S1, SW+S2) and get the longer
        BLE_QUERY_DELAY_MULTIPART.

        post-hello burst window — see BLE_HYDRATE_BURST_CLEAR_DELAY_S and

        and the task handle.

        Four things happen here, in order, and the order matters:

        1. Sleep `initial_delay`. For a sweep triggered by a fresh connect this
           is what keeps our commands OUT of the node's own post-hello burst
           (BLE_HYDRATE_BURST_CLEAR_DELAY_S); for the no-hello paths it is just
           enough to let the caller return first (BLE_HYDRATE_QUIET_DELAY_S), or
           long enough to let a racing register replay land first
           (BLE_HYDRATE_REPLAY_GRACE_DELAY_S).
        2. Re-check that the link is actually up, and — where the client
           supports it — re-check it against `ble_service` rather than the
           local cache. The cache is deliberately distrusted at this point:
           seconds have passed since scheduling, and in the SSE-recovery case
           the cache says DISCONNECTED precisely because the SSE stream (not
           the radio) dropped. `refresh_status()` is what corrects that, and it
           is safe to spend an HTTP round trip on here in a way it was not in
           the old inline-at-startup version, because nothing is waiting.
        3. If `skip_if_complete` and every REQUIRED_BLE_REGISTER_TYPES is
           already in `cached_ble_registers`, stop here — no RF, and no
           closing device-info broadcast either. That broadcast exists to push
           a freshly-swept result to every connected client; when the cache was
           already complete there is nothing new to push, and the SSE snapshot
           each client already read (or the replay that just filled the cache)
           already serves it. Logged at INFO so a completeness-driven no-op is
           visible in the log the same way a real sweep is.
        4. Sweep every register, then push the device-info frame — the second
           half of what the legacy `connect BLE` command did via
           `_handle_ble_info_command(websocket, query_registers=False)`.
           `None` for the websocket makes it a broadcast: a scheduled sweep has
           no originating socket, and every connected client wants the result.

        NOT RE-ENTRANT, AND CANNOT BECOME SO. `_handle_ble_info_command` now
        SCHEDULES a sweep of its own when `query_registers` is True, so step 4
        passes False explicitly. That is what keeps the composition acyclic: a
        sweep can never schedule a sweep. Even if that False were ever lost the
        result would be a skip, not a deadlock — `schedule_ble_register_hydration`
        is synchronous and would simply observe its own task as in-flight — but
        the flag is the real guarantee, not the guard.

        NEVER RAISES, by construction. It runs detached, so an escaping
        exception would land in the event loop's unhandled-exception handler
        (a bare "Task exception was never retrieved" traceback with no context)
        and, worse, would leave the frontend on placeholder values with nothing
        in the log tying the two together. Timeout and failure are logged and
        swallowed; `CancelledError` is a `BaseException` and so passes through
        both handlers untouched, which is what shutdown needs.

        this call started one, False if it was skipped.

        THE ENTRY POINT for every non-legacy path that needs
        `cached_ble_registers` populated: the `POST /api/ble/ensure_connected`
        route, the startup re-query against a reused connection, and
        `BLEClientRemote`'s SSE-recovery hook. All three have the same two
        constraints — the sweep costs ~9 s of deliberate command spacing, and
        none of them may pay that cost inline (an HTTP route would hang, and
        `build_app()` would hold the SSE server's bind hostage).

        `after_hello` and `replay_grace` together select the initial delay and
        are the caller's assertion about what it just did or is racing:

        * `after_hello=True` (a fresh connect just happened, the node is
          draining its own post-hello burst) waits BLE_HYDRATE_BURST_CLEAR_DELAY_S
          for that window to close.
        * `after_hello=False, replay_grace=True` (no hello, but this call races
          `BLEClientRemote`'s SSE-attach register replay — the startup
          already-CONNECTED re-query and the SSE-recovery hook, both of which
          fire in the same breath as a replay of ble_service's own register
          cache) waits the longer BLE_HYDRATE_REPLAY_GRACE_DELAY_S, so the
          completeness check below sees the replay's result rather than racing
          it.
        * `after_hello=False, replay_grace=False` (no hello, nothing to race)
          uses the short BLE_HYDRATE_QUIET_DELAY_S — just enough for the
          caller to return first.

        Two flags rather than a raw delay or an enum, so `ble_client_remote`
        can call this with plain keyword bools without importing timing
        constants (or a delay type) from `main` — that import direction is a
        cycle.

        `skip_if_complete`, when True, asks the sweep to check
        `cached_ble_registers` against REQUIRED_BLE_REGISTER_TYPES once it
        actually starts (after the initial delay) and do nothing at all —
        no RF, no broadcast — if the set is already complete. This is for
        "ensure populated" callers (the startup re-query, the SSE-recovery
        hook, the completeness reconciler's own re-ask) where a replay or an
        earlier sweep may have already finished the job by the time this one
        would run. It defaults to False and MUST stay False for "explicit
        refresh" callers — the legacy `connect BLE` / `info BLE` commands and
        `POST /api/ble/ensure_connected` — where a user or the webapp is
        asking for current values on purpose and a silent no-op would be
        wrong even with a full cache. See `_run_ble_register_hydration` for
        where the check actually runs.

        SINGLE-FLIGHT, RESOLVED AS *SKIP*, NOT SUPERSEDE. A second request
        arriving while a sweep is scheduled or running is dropped (logged at
        debug, reported as False). Two interleaved sequences would violate the
        one-command-per-tick spacing the whole method depends on, so doing
        nothing is not the only option — but skip beats cancel-and-restart for
        one specific reason: the sweep is fully idempotent and re-reads every
        register anyway, so a skipped request loses nothing, whereas
        superseding restarts the ~9 s clock and a user impatiently re-clicking
        "connect" every few seconds could keep cancelling the sweep just
        before it finishes and never see a single register. Skip guarantees
        forward progress; supersede does not.

        The known cost of that choice: a request that would have used the LONG
        burst-clearing delay is skipped in favour of an already-scheduled sweep
        that used the short one, so a reconnect landing inside an in-flight
        sweep can overlap the node's burst. That is wasteful (duplicate frames,
        drained at the firmware's own >=300 ms pace) but not harmful, and it
        needs a second connect within ~10 s of a restart to happen at all.

        THE FIX for the 2026-08-21 outage: a deploy that restarts mcapp and
        ble_service together left `cached_ble_registers` empty forever,
        because every existing trigger fires once and gives up — the startup
        re-query races ble_service's ~10s connect pipeline and always loses
        when both restart together, and a hydration sweep that skips because
        the link looks disconnected at that instant (main.py's own
        `_run_ble_register_hydration`) had nothing left armed afterwards. This
        method is the thing every "the link is connected, or might be soon"
        event arms instead of (or alongside) a single sweep, so a lost race or
        a mid-flight skip gets a second, third, and Nth chance rather than
        silence.

        Call at any of: a transition to CONNECTED (mcapp-initiated, in
        `BLEClientRemote.connect`/`ensure_connected`, or OBSERVED via an SSE
        status event in `BLEClientRemote._handle_status`); CONFFIN received
        (`BLEClientRemote._handle_notification`); the register cache being
        wiped while the link is still actually connected
        (`_clear_ble_cache_on_disconnect`, defensive — every current wipe path
        also marks the client disconnected, so this should be a no-op in
        practice); and startup finding a connection ble_service kept alive
        across an mcapp restart (`requery_reused_ble_connection`, which this
        replaced the one-shot sweep in).

        SINGLE TASK, NOT RE-ARMED ON TOP OF ITSELF. A reconciler already
        running is left alone — its own next check (at most

        the same "skip beats cancel-and-restart" reasoning as
        `schedule_ble_register_hydration`. Returns True iff this call started
        a new reconciler loop, False if one was already armed or no event
        loop is running — never raises, mirroring that method's contract, for
        the same reason: every caller is a non-critical background hook that

        method's branch count under ruff's ceiling — there is no other
        caller and no state lives here between calls (the de-spam state DOES
        live between calls, but it lives in the caller's local, passed
        nowhere near here — see `_run_ble_register_reconciler`).

        Disarms (`keep_looping=False`) if the BLE client is gone or reports
        DISCONNECTED/ERROR/DISCONNECTING. Keeps looping (`keep_looping=True`,
        without asking for a sweep — there is nothing to sweep yet) if it
        reports CONNECTING. Disarms silently once `cached_ble_registers`
        covers every REQUIRED_BLE_REGISTER_TYPES. Otherwise asks for another
        sweep via `schedule_ble_register_hydration`, with
        `skip_if_complete=True` — `missing` was non-empty at THIS check, but
        the requested sweep only actually runs after its own initial delay,
        and by then a CONFFIN-driven burst still draining or a replay
        elsewhere may have finished the job on its own; asking it to check
        again immediately before sweeping avoids paying the full ~9 s of RF
        for nothing (its own single-flight guard may also SKIP this outright
        — that is fine, it means one is already running, and the caller
        re-checks on its own cadence regardless of whether that particular
        request was skipped, completeness-skipped, or acted on) and returns
        `keep_looping=True`.

        `delay` is the CURRENT cadence step (the one just slept), passed in
        only to decide whether THIS check has reached the steady cadence —
        it plays no part in choosing the next delay, which the caller
        computes. THIS METHOD DOES NOT DECIDE THE LOG LEVEL for a non-empty
        missing set: at steady cadence it hands the missing set back to the
        caller via the result's `missing` field (None otherwise) and lets
        `_run_ble_register_reconciler`'s de-spam state machine
        (`_log_missing_registers_despammed`) decide WARNING vs. DEBUG vs. the
        one-shot escalation. That decision needs state carried across many
        calls, which does not belong here (see the branch-count note above);
        this method stays a stateless per-check fact-finder.

        CONNECTING IS NOT A DISARM REASON (advisor rework R1b). ble_service
        pushes `reconnecting` (-> CONNECTING) before `connected` on EVERY
        connect ladder — verified against ble_service's own connect code and
        the live 2026-08-21 journal — so a check landing while the link is
        still mid-connect is the *common* case, not an anomaly: the very
        first check (15s after arming) races it routinely, as does a check
        whose `refresh_status()` round trip overlaps a mid-session reconnect.
        Treating CONNECTING as "disarm" (as this used to) meant the startup
        arm gave up silently on exactly the fleet-real ordering this whole
        mechanism exists to survive. The cadence still advances on a
        CONNECTING check (so a permanently-stuck-CONNECTING link still
        reaches the steady 600s WARNING eventually, worded slightly
        differently from the "missing TYPs" one since there is no register
        list to name yet) — this just doesn't give up on it, and doesn't
        waste a sweep request on a link that cannot answer one. This
        WARNING is deliberately NOT de-spammed like the "missing TYPs" one:
        it repeats every steady-cadence check for as long as the link stays
        stuck CONNECTING, unchanged from before this de-spam mechanism
        existed.

        holding a connection from BEFORE the restart — or, since a deploy
        restarts both processes together, about to finish establishing one.

        `ble_service` is a separate, long-lived process; a plain `mcapp`
        restart never re-triggers the device's own hello handshake, so the
        firmware's auto-config push (the only thing that normally delivers the
        register set — see `_query_ble_registers`'s docstring) never fires
        either. Called once from `build_app()` right after
        `ble_client.start()`; a no-op when no BLE client is registered at all
        (e.g. disabled BLE mode).

        THE ALREADY-CONNECTED CASE: if `client.status.state` is already
        CONNECTED here, `ble_service` was fully up before this process even
        started, there was never a connect race to lose, and the sweep is
        still scheduled immediately. It now races something else, though:
        `BLEClientRemote`'s own SSE loop reaches this same startup moment via
        its first successful `/api/ble/notifications` connect, which pulls
        ble_service's register cache through `_replay_cached_registers` —
        typically landing in ~1-1.5 s with zero RF. This call and that replay
        run concurrently, and until this fix the sweep below used the short
        BLE_HYDRATE_QUIET_DELAY_S=1 s, which only beat the replay by luck
        (verified live 2026-08-21: replay logged complete at 20:19:37, the
        sweep started at 20:19:38 — one second later, and the replay does not
        always finish that fast). `replay_grace=True` swaps in the longer
        BLE_HYDRATE_REPLAY_GRACE_DELAY_S so the completeness check that
        `skip_if_complete=True` performs once the sweep actually starts
        reliably sees the replay's result: a landed replay makes the ~9 s,
        10-command RF sweep a pure no-op (logged, not run); a replay that
        never lands (older ble_service, no such endpoint, or a genuinely
        incomplete cache) still gets the full sweep, exactly as before.

        THE NOT-YET-CONNECTED CASE NO LONGER GIVES UP — this is the
        2026-08-21 outage fix. `ble_client.start()` returns after a single
        status check, long before ble_service's own connect pipeline
        (~2 s ExecStartPre + 8 s AUTO_CONNECT_DELAY, ~10 s total) has
        necessarily finished, so `client.status.state` here was routinely
        still DISCONNECTED/CONNECTING whenever both processes restarted
        together — a race the old version always lost by simply returning,
        leaving `cached_ble_registers` empty forever with nothing armed.
        Arming the reconciler instead fixes that: its own first check runs
        ~15 s later (BLE_RECONCILE_FIRST_CHECK_DELAY_S), which is enough
        slack for the connect pipeline to land, and if the client genuinely
        never connects (nothing paired, or BLE really is disabled) that first
        check just finds it still not CONNECTED and disarms itself — no harm
        done, no sweep ever issued.

        Still self-contained by construction, because the caller cannot afford
        the other failure mode either: this NEVER RAISES. The call site sits
        inside `build_app()`'s "Failed to initialize BLE client" handler, whose
        recovery is to tear the working remote client down and fall back to
        DISABLED BLE mode for the entire process lifetime. Letting a failed
        register refresh reach that handler would trade the mesh link for a
        weather seed.

        STILL LIVE CODE. The webapp's main connect flow moved to
        `POST /api/ble/ensure_connected`, but `retryConnect()` still sends this
        command, so this path has to stay correct — it is not dead.

        It used to sweep the registers INLINE
        (`_query_ble_registers(wait_for_hello=not already_connected)`) and only
        then answer the caller. That was wrong twice over, and the second half
        is the interesting one:

        * It blocked the command handler for the whole sweep — ~3.4 s when the
          sweep was three commands, and ~9 s now that it is ten.
        * On the fresh-connect branch it fired those commands ~1-2 s after the
          hello, i.e. squarely INSIDE the node's 3 s send-freeze and the burst
          drain that follows it (see BLE_HYDRATE_BURST_CLEAR_DELAY_S). So it
          paid the full latency to ask for registers the node had already
          queued and was about to send anyway — and pushed its ring buffer
          while doing it. The answers that came back were the burst's, not the
          query's.

        So the sweep is scheduled instead, with `after_hello` derived from what
        actually happened on THIS invocation: a fresh connect just did a hello
        and the node is mid-burst (True -> wait the burst out), while the
        `already_connected` branch did no hello at all and has no burst to
        clear (False -> the short quiet delay).

        The synchronous half of the old contract is unchanged: the caller
        (`retryConnect()`'s websocket) still gets its `blueZ` info frame from
        `_handle_ble_info_command`, on the same socket, before this returns.
        Only the register re-query moved off the critical path.
