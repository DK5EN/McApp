#     number, a pair key, or a hashtag channel) — it is used to QUERY stored
#     messages and never reaches the wire at all.
#   - "command": dst is an unused placeholder the webapp always sends as the
#     literal 'TEST' (route_command ignores request.dst entirely).
#   - everything else ("BLE", the default "msg", and any other value): dst is
#     the real on-air destination, framed as `{dst}msg` and subject to the

#   '>' - terminates the path/destination segment (the char between src and dst)

#   '!' - APRS position-report payload-type marker (first byte of msg)

#   '{' / '}' - the node-side wire frame delimiters (`snprintf(val, 160,

#     re-frames where the destination ends and the message text begins on the

#     treats a closing '}' at index >= 11 as evidence the destination field
#     never closed, leaves the resolved destination as '*', and the message
#     goes out as a BROADCAST with braces baked into the text instead of the
#     intended DM.
# Plus NUL and any other C0 (0x00-0x1F) or C1 (0x7F-0x9F) control character --
# none has a legitimate place in a destination and any could corrupt logs or a
# downstream terminal.
