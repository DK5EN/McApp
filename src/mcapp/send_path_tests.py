"""End-to-end guard for the OUTBOUND send path (the layer where the `!wx text:`
raw-leak actually shipped).

The leaf `extract_target_callsign` and the `should_suppress_outbound` decision are
each unit-tested elsewhere, but nothing drove the real wiring
`_handle_outbound → suppression → transport`. A normalization or routing
regression there could forward a locally-resolvable command RAW to the mesh while
every leaf test stays green. This suite closes that gap by running messages
through the real `MessageRouter._handle_outbound` with a recording transport and
asserting what does — and does not — reach the wire. It also guards the OTHER half
of the contract (`_resolve_and_capture`): a command addressed to us must resolve
AND its reply must be TRANSMITTED to the mesh — the mock had exactly the inverse
bug (resolved !wx but never uplinked the reply).

Network-free: the raw-suppression cases use a bare router (nothing resolves the
weather); the reply-transmission case stubs the weather fetch. No DWD/OpenMeteo
call happens in either.

      wire) — permissive rule (<=64 chars, no strict 9-char cap: hashtag
      channels and long special-event callsigns are real conversation keys).
    * "command": dst is an unused placeholder (the webapp always sends
      'TEST') — same permissive rule, and no {dst}msg frame-size check at all
      (a command's `msg` is an ASCII command string, not on-air text).
    * "BLE": {dst}msg goes straight over the BLE characteristic. Strict dst
      grammar (1..9 chars, extudp_functions.cpp getExtern()'s `iCall < 11`
      range; no '{'/'}' — the node-side `:{%s}%s` frame delimiters, see the
      module comment on `_DST_STRICT_FORBIDDEN_CHARS_RE`) plus a 160-byte
      total frame cap (2 literal brace bytes + dst + msg, sendMessage()
      ~:3388's hard drop threshold).
    * everything else (the default "msg" type included): also routed to the
      wire (Extern-UDP -> UDPHandler.send_message), so it gets the SAME
      strict dst grammar, but a TIGHTER frame cap — 159 bytes (3 literal
      ':'/'{'/'}' bytes + dst + msg, the node's own
      `snprintf(val, 160, ":{%s}%s", dst, msg)` re-wrap) — plus getExtern()'s
      independent 150-byte msg-alone acceptance range.

    All byte counts are UTF-8 BYTES, matching the firmware — Python's `len()`
    on `str` counts characters, which undercounts any multi-byte UTF-8
    character (umlaut, emoji). Rejected, not truncated: a direct API caller
    gets a 422 instead of silent on-air clipping/corruption.

    Also guards the compatibility case this repo's own webapp depends on:
    a `type: "page_request"`/`"command"` body that omits `msg` entirely must
    still validate (pydantic's untouched default, never re-validated against
