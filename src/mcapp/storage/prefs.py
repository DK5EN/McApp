      * already a '<>'-joined pair key             -> unchanged (idempotent)
      * 'A~B' (third-party pair)                   -> sorted([A, B]) '<>'-joined
      * group / hashtag / '*' / 'Time' (verbatim)   -> unchanged
      * a shape compute_conversation_key REFUSES    -> unchanged (see below)

    The last branch is what a digit-less partner base (e.g. 'WLNK') used to
    miss client-side: the webapp's own plausibility guard on the reverse
    translation returned such a key unchanged instead of pairing it with
    `my_base`, so it never reaches this function looking like 'WLNK<>DK5EN'
    on the way in — it arrives as the bare partner base, exactly like any
    other own-DM partner, and this last branch is what pairs it correctly.

    The refusal branch mirrors `compute_conversation_key`'s own (constants.py:
    a '#'-prefixed key failing the tag charset, or an all-ASCII-digit key
    outside the 1..99999 group range, gets NO conversation key at all).
    Those rows are keyed by `COALESCE(conversation_key, dst)` on the read
    path, so the server key IS the raw dst ('0', '#OE_SOTA') and the sidebar
    key is that same string — NOT an own-DM partner. Pairing it here would
    address a conversation that does not exist, which is the very bug this
    module exists to fix, just pointed at a different set of keys. The
    webapp's `serverKeyForSidebarKey` carries the identical branch; the two
    must agree.

        New {CET} messages are dropped by _should_filter_message, so the
        Time branch only removes pre-filter legacy rows.
        Personal (callsign): delete bidirectional using conversation_key.
        Matching only conversation_key is complete: type='ack' rows no
        longer exist (the v4 migration removed them and store_message
        never inserts them).
        Also cleans up the read_counts entry — keyed by read_key (the
        frontend sidebar key, e.g. pair 'A~B') when provided, else dst.

        The webapp overloads this call to address a specific third-party pair
        conversation: for an 'A~B' sidebar bucket it POSTs {dst: A, own_call:
        B, read_key: "A~B"}. Several distinct pairs can share the same bare
        dst (e.g. DD7MH<>HB3XTK and DD7MH<>DH1FR both log under dst=DD7MH), so
        the completion log line below includes own_call and read_key too —
        dst alone can't tell two such deletes apart. A personal delete that
        matches zero rows is also triaged (separate from the empty-own_call
        case below): own_call being merely WRONG — bad case, bad base
        callsign — is otherwise a silent, permanent no-op, since the route
        answers 200 either way.

        That triage is deliberately NOT "warn on every zero". Deleting a
        conversation that is genuinely already empty is normal: the webapp can
        offer a bucket whose rows the retention prune already removed, or that
        only ever existed in its IndexedDB offline cache, and it double-deletes
        on a rapid re-click. The frontend classifies exactly that case as
        expected and stays silent for it (stores/messages.ts,
        `hadServerRecord`); if this side warned on it anyway the two halves
        would disagree about what a failure is, and the journal would fill with
        warnings nobody can action. So on a zero match we ask the DB which
        case it is: if rows for this dst exist under a DIFFERENT conversation
        key, own_call really is wrong (the incident signature) — warn, and name
        the keys that DO exist, which is the one line that would have solved
        it. If the dst has no conversation at all, it was simply empty — log
        it at INFO and move on.
