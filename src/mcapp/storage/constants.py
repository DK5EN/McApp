    Via-routed dst is 'VIA[,VIA2],TARGET' — the real target is the LAST
    comma component (e.g. 'OE1KBC-12,232' → group 232). The src field
    carries the relay path the other way round: FIRST component = sender.

    The group branch delegates to the unified cross-repo predicate
    (commands/parsing.py:is_group; contracts ./conversation_key_vectors.json v2
    and ../commands/group_dst_vectors.json). An in-range group target keeps its
    RAW string as the key (string-preserving: '00232' → '00232', 'test' →
    'test'), while an all-ASCII-digit target OUTSIDE 1..99999 ('0', '100000')
    yields None — no bucket at all. Callers fall back to
    COALESCE(conversation_key, dst), so client-visible partitioning for such
    traffic is unchanged.

    v4 adds the hashtag branch (commands/parsing.py:is_hashtag; contracts
    ../commands/hashtag_dst_vectors.json and ./conversation_key_vectors.json
    v4): a '#TAG' destination keys on the resolved tag VERBATIM — string-
    preserving exactly like the group branch, case included — and this check
    runs AFTER is_group/'*' but BEFORE the all-ASCII-digit branch, so a
    hashtag never reaches the DM fallback below. Before this fix a '#'-
    prefixed dst fell into the DM branch, which split it on its first hyphen
    ('#OE-SOTA' → conversation key '#OE<>DK5EN'), fragmenting one tag per
    sender and colliding distinct tags that share a prefix. A '#'-prefixed
    dst that fails the tag charset (bare '#', '#OE_SOTA') yields None — no
    bucket at all, NOT a degenerate DM pair — mirroring dst_kind's 'unknown'
    classification for the same input.

    v5 adds the non-person-alias branch (NON_PERSON_DST_ALIASES; contract
    ./conversation_key_vectors.json v5): a dst of 'ALL' or 'TIME', checked
    case-insensitively, keys on the resolved target VERBATIM — string-
    preserving exactly like the group/hashtag branches above ('Time' keys
    'Time', not 'TIME') — and this check runs AFTER is_group/'*'/is_hashtag
    but BEFORE the malformed-hashtag/all-ASCII-digit branch, so neither alias
    ever reaches the DM fallback below. Before this fix such a dst fell into
    the DM branch and was keyed as an ordinary DM pair ('ALL<>DK6GC',
    'DK6GC<>TIME'); the webapp refuses both as pair members
    (NON_PERSON_PAIR_MEMBERS in src/utils/callsignUtils.ts), so the server
    would advertise a conversation the client silently drops. Never observed
    in production (zero rows in 5488 messages) — this closes a latent trap,
    not an active bug. 'TEST' is deliberately NOT in this set: is_group
    already claims it case-insensitively on the branch above, so adding it

    back silently on close with no error anywhere. The bare ``conn`` context
    manager supplies that back (commits on success, rolls back on error);
    ``closing`` still does the closing. Both are required, in this order. See
    storage/connection_lifecycle_tests.py for the regression coverage.

    Sets this connection's ``synchronous`` pragma to ``NORMAL`` before yielding it.

    every commit, which on the production Pi's SD card was measured
    2026-09-16 at 15 ms typical, up to 1.7 s, per commit at FULL vs. ~0.3 ms
    at NORMAL — but NOT the entire cause of the F1 handler stalls, as this
    docstring used to claim. NORMAL still fsyncs at WAL checkpoints, so the
    database file itself can never be corrupted; the trade is that the last
    transaction(s) can be lost on a power loss or OS crash between commit and
    the next checkpoint, which is accepted here. The pragma is per-connection,
    so ``db_read`` (no commits, nothing to fsync) is deliberately left at the
    SQLite default.

    The second half of the F1 cause, found 2026-09-18: closing the LAST
    connection to a WAL database checkpoints and deletes the WAL file, which
    is itself a DB-file fsync (measured 23.7 ms per write vs. ~0.2 ms on a
    persistent connection) — and this function's own ``with closing(...):``
    paid that cost on every single call, since each call's connection was the
    only one open. `sqlite_storage.SQLiteStorage` now avoids it for its own
    write path by keeping ONE persistent writer connection
    (``_writer_conn``/``_get_writer_conn``) instead of calling ``db_write`` for
    `_mutate`/`_execute_many`. This function is unchanged and still used by
    every other write site (prefs, classifier_api, uptime, stalls,
    sse_handler, migrations) — those sites benefit automatically once the
    writer connection is open, because their per-call connection is then never
    the LAST one to a WAL database with a live writer already attached.
