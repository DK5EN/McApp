"""Regression suite for the unread-cursor rework (`read_cursors`,
`get_conversation_summary`, `PrefsMixin.set_read_cursor`/`get_read_cursors`/
`seed_read_cursors_from_counts`).

Backend half of doc/2026-09-06_1200-unread-cursor-plan.md §7, cases 1-4 and 7
(cases 5/6 — SSE burst ordering and the `proxy:read_cursor` echo to a second
client — belong to the sibling wave touching sse_handler.py/main.py).

Mirrors the ephemeral-tempfile pattern of `storage/migration_chain_tests.py`
and `storage/uptime_tests.py`: a throwaway SQLite DB per scenario, real
production entry points (`store_message`, `get_conversation_summary`,
`set_read_cursor`, `get_read_cursors`, `seed_read_cursors_from_counts`,
`delete_messages_by_dst`) — never a reimplementation of their logic. Rows are
inserted via `store_message` wherever the test needs a real `conversation_key`
computed by production code, mirroring `query_tests.py`'s fixtures.

Coverage:
  1. Own-message exclusion by BASE callsign (plan D3): both `DK5EN-98` and
     `DK5EN-14` sends are excluded from `unread` when `my_callsign` is
     `DK5EN-98`, while a partner's reply still counts.
  2. Cursor semantics: a missing cursor counts everything; `ts > cursor` is
     STRICT (a message stamped exactly at the cursor is not unread).
  3. `set_read_cursor` never regresses (MAX) and returns the value actually
     stored, not the value passed in.
  4. `seed_read_cursors_from_counts` translation: a group key (verbatim), an
     own-DM partner key (`DK3PB` -> `DK3PB<>DK5EN`), an `A~B` pair key
     (`DK3PB~OE1XYZ` -> `DK3PB<>OE1XYZ`), N-th-oldest timestamp selection,
     `N` exceeding the row count falling back to `now()`, a `N <= 0` row being
     skipped outright, and the whole pass being idempotent (a second call
     writes nothing).
  7. The blocklist branch rebuckets a quarantined group post's count/last_ts/
     unread under `SPAM_GROUP`, exactly like `get_smart_initial_with_summary`
     — including Finding 2 of unread-cursor-verdict.md: a cursor on EITHER
     the SPAM_GROUP key or the original key clears the rebucketed unread
     count (MAX semantics against both), so the 9999 badge actually clears.

  Also (out of the plan's numbered list, but this suite's own file set):
  `delete_messages_by_dst` removes the matching `read_cursors` row so a
  deleted conversation cannot leave behind a stale cursor for whatever
  reoccupies that key — including Finding 4: 'Time' and '*' are distinct
  cursor keys, and deleting one must never remove the other's cursor.
  Finding 6: seeding with an empty `my_callsign` writes nothing and leaves
  the `read_cursors_seeded` marker unset, so a later boot with the real
  callsign configured retries instead of silently writing 0 forever.

  Digit-less DM partner base (doc/2026-09-19_0006-unread-badge-digitless-
  callsign-plan.md, Wave 1a): `conversation_key_for_sidebar_key` pairs a
  digit-less partner base like 'WLNK' with `my_base` instead of returning it
  unchanged, leaves every verbatim/'<>'/'A~B' shape as documented, `POST
  /api/read_cursor` (called directly via its route function, not through
  TestClient/ASGI) normalises before writing/looking up/broadcasting so the
  badge actually clears end to end, and `repair_read_cursor_dm_keys` heals
  rows already written under the bare key on an already-affected install.

All timestamps are milliseconds (project-wide DB convention).
