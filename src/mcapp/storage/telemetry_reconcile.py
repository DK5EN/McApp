"""Pure, database-free reconcile core for `store_telemetry`'s dedup/merge policy.

`store_telemetry` (`storage/ingest.py`) decides, for every second telemetry
observation of the same station inside its dedup window, what happens to the
row already on disk. That policy used to be hand-written as imperative
branches with a DIFFERENT field list in each branch — the root cause of
several production regressions in one day (see the Fable verdict, findings
V1/V2/V3/V6):

  - V1: the replace path treated "incoming" as synonymous with "newer" and
    let it win ties unconditionally. `ble_service` buffers notifications in
    a `deque(maxlen=1000)` whenever mcapp's SSE consumer is away — i.e.
    every mcapp restart, including every deploy — then flushes them
    carrying their ORIGINAL timestamps. A replayed frame is therefore
    routinely OLDER than the row it meets inside the dedup window, and
    "incoming wins" silently overwrote live data with stale data and moved
    the row's timestamp backwards.
  - V2: the MERGE branch carried only `temp2`/`hum2`/`extras`, so an arriving
    frame with `gas`/`co2`/`batt`/`hum` the existing row lacked silently lost
    all four — and this was symmetric: an existing row holding gas/co2/batt
    lost them just as easily when a later frame won only on `qfe`, because
    the branch merging fields in one direction was not the branch replacing
    the row in the other.
  - V3: `(existing has no qfe, incoming has no qfe)` matched neither branch
    and fell through to an INSERT — a duplicate row on every beacon for any
    station without a pressure sensor.
  - V6: `if not val:` treated a genuine `0.0` reading as absence and
    resurrected the previous row's stale value.

This module replaces all of that with one function, `reconcile()`, computed
uniformly over a single field-list constant (`ALL_FIELDS`) so it is
impossible to give one code path a shorter field list than another, and
structured so there is no branch combination left unhandled (`existing is
None` and "does anything change" are exhaustive booleans, not a set of named
predicate branches that a new case can slip between).

Design:

  - `Provenance` ranks how a value was obtained: `ABSENT` (no value) <
    `DERIVED` (e.g. the barometric QNH+altitude estimate for `qfe`) <
    `MEASURED` (a real sensor reading off the wire). Precedence is
    MEASURED > DERIVED > ABSENT, per field, and a DERIVED reading never
    overwrites a MEASURED one — regardless of which observation is
    chronologically newer (see `_choose`).
  - Provenance alone cannot resolve every case: two readings of EQUAL
    provenance (both MEASURED, or both DERIVED) must be broken by which
    observation is chronologically newer, NOT by which one is "incoming" —
    that was V1. Callers must pass `incoming_is_newer` explicitly; there is
    no default, so it cannot be silently forgotten.
  - `Reading` pairs a value with its `Provenance` and enforces, by
    construction, that `ABSENT` iff `value is None` — so `0.0` (a perfectly
    ordinary winter temperature here) can never be mistaken for "no
    reading". There is no truthiness check anywhere in this module.
  - `reconcile()` takes the existing row's readings (or `None` if no row is
    in the dedup window) and the incoming frame's readings, both keyed by
    the exact same `ALL_FIELDS`, and returns one `Action` plus the merged
    reading for every field. `existing=None` is the only path that can
    produce `Action.INSERT`; every other combination lands on `SKIP`,
    `UPDATE_EXISTING` or `REPLACE_EXISTING` — never a second INSERT for a
    station already inside the window (closing the V3 hole structurally,
    not by adding a branch for the specific combination that was missing).
    `Action` governs the `telemetry` ROW only — see `Action.SKIP`.
  - `extras` (the opaque JSON blob of unrecognised `/KEY=` values) is NOT
    one of `ALL_FIELDS` and is not decided by `reconcile()` at all: it is
    not an observation with a provenance, it is an accumulating bag of
    miscellaneous keys, and merging it under MEASURED/DERIVED precedence
    would let a later frame's blob silently evict keys the earlier blob had
    that the later one doesn't mention. Use `merge_extras()` instead.

`alt` (altitude) is likewise deliberately NOT one of `ALL_FIELDS`, for the
same class of reason: it is positional metadata — where the station is —
not a sensor reading subject to measured/derived precedence, and
`store_telemetry` already resolves it separately (from the incoming frame
or, failing that, from `station_positions`) before any dedup decision is
made. Callers reconcile `alt` themselves, upstream of `reconcile()`.

`column_names()` / `values_for()` give wave 2 a single source for the SQL
column order of the fields this module DOES own, so the INSERT and UPDATE
statements bind values from the same call instead of two hand-typed lists
(the exact shape of the V2 drift).

Pure: no DB, no clock, no I/O, deterministic. No imports from `storage.ingest`.

    reintroduced by a future caller passing `None` alongside a non-ABSENT
    provenance, or a falsy-but-real value alongside `ABSENT`.

    DECODING SENTINELS IS THE CALLER'S JOB, AND IT IS TRANSPORT-DEPENDENT.
    This module refuses to guess: it has no truthiness check anywhere, so it
    cannot tell a real 0.0 from a wire sentinel, and mapping one rule over
    both transports is wrong in both directions:

    * Extern-UDP `tele` JSON emits EVERY key unconditionally from
      zero-initialised fields (`extudp_functions.cpp:450-459` and
      `:470-480`), so there `0` means "no sensor fitted" and must become
      `absent()`. Mapping it to `measured(0.0)` makes a sensorless node's
      zeros tie with, and on newer timestamps beat, a real reading from the
      other transport — reproducing the gas/CO2 destruction of verdict
      V2a case (b) through fully contract-compliant wiring.
    * The BLE APRS text path emits a `/KEY=` only when the sensor is real
      (`loop_functions.cpp:3646-3699`), so there a parsed `0.0` is genuine
      and must become `measured(0.0)`. Mapping it to `absent()` is V6
      verbatim.

    Provenance of values read back from the `telemetry` table: label
    non-NULL columns `MEASURED`. Provenance is not persisted, and the
    plausible-looking alternative — "we cannot prove it was measured, call
    it DERIVED" — hands every replayed stale frame a `prov >` win that
    bypasses the chronology gate entirely, rebuilding V1 in the caller while
    this module works exactly as designed. Accepted limitation of labelling
    MEASURED: an older replayed measured `/P=` will not displace a newer
    derived qfe. That costs a few hPa on one row and is the safe direction.

      `NULLIF(x, 0)` guards were removed once sentinel decoding moved upstream,
      so a genuine 0 now reaches the cache), and binding raw frame values on a
      path that just decided they must not win the `telemetry` row lets stale readings
      overwrite current ones on the very path that just decided they must
      not win the `telemetry` row.
    * Bind `max(existing_ts, incoming_ts)` for `telemetry_ts`, not the
      incoming frame's timestamp. Unlike `last_seen`, `telemetry_ts` has no
      `MAX()` guard in the upsert (`ingest.py`, `telemetry_ts =
      excluded.telemetry_ts`), so a replayed frame — every deploy flushes up
      to 1000 of them from ble_service's buffer, carrying original
      timestamps — would walk the station's freshness backwards by up to the

    frame may re-stamp the row (see the `Action` selection below). It is

    Equal timestamps count as NOT newer: derive it as
    `incoming_ts > existing_ts`, so an exactly-simultaneous frame leaves the

    churning the row.

    The caller must derive this from the two stored timestamps, NOT from
