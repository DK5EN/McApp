"""Regression suite for the nightly prune/rollup logic in `query.py`.

This is the exact area that bit once in production (the mHeard-gap bug:
`_nightly_prune` job ordering + naive-`utcnow` TZ handling — see
`doc/charts-wrong.md` §13 and the NOTE block in `QueryMixin.prune_messages`).
It earns real coverage.

Mirrors the ephemeral-tempfile pattern of `sqlite_storage.run_startup_tests`
and the classifier suite: a throwaway SQLite DB is created per run so the live
DB is never touched. Exposes `run_query_tests() -> bool` (async — the startup
orchestrator awaits it).

Coverage:
  (a) `aggregate_hourly_buckets` count-weighted averaging is EXACT — seed 5-min
      buckets with known counts + rssi/snr, assert the by-hand count-weighted
      hourly average and min/max/count.
  (b) Ordering invariant — aggregate-THEN-prune preserves history that
      prune-THEN-aggregate would lose (the production bug class). Both orders are
      run on identical seed data and the surviving hourly history is asserted.
  (c) Prune cutoffs are UTC-correct — `prune_messages` uses TZ-aware UTC
      (`datetime.now(UTC)`), not naive local wall-clock. Rows straddling the
      8-day pos cutoff by ±30 min are seeded; the correct ones must survive. A
      naive-local cutoff (non-zero UTC offset ≥ 1 h) would shift the boundary
      past both rows and fail this test.
  (d) The ':ack<N>' predicate seam (ack_predicate_vectors.json v2, single
      strict tier) — replays the vendored fixture's `is_ack` column against
      BOTH directions of the REAL SQL clause pair query.py's read paths use
      (exclusion "... AND msg NOT GLOB '*:ack[0-9]*'", acks query
      "msg GLOB '*:ack[0-9]*'" — asserting they are exact complements per
      vector), and its `is_ack`/`ack_number` columns against a documented
      literal mirror of ingest.py's regex (see the comment above
      _INGEST_ACK_REGEX_MIRROR for why it's a mirror, not a call into
      ingest.py — that call site has no clean seam to unit test in isolation
      without a much larger harness).
  (e) Case-sensitivity drift, behaviorally — a human message containing
      ':ACK99' and a real firmware ack ':ack931' are inserted, then the REAL
      client-facing query methods (get_messages_page,
      get_smart_initial_with_summary) are asserted on: the ':ACK99' row must
      come back as a normal message and NOT as an ack. Under the pre-v2
      case-insensitive `LIKE '%:ack%'` SQL it silently vanished from history
      sync (SQLite LIKE is case-insensitive for ASCII) while the webapp
      showed it live.
  (f) Hashtag destinations (hashtag_dst_vectors.json, conversation_key_vectors.json
      v4) — `get_messages_page`'s dispatch used to evaluate `is_dm` before
      `is_group_dst`, and `is_dm` was true for a hashtag dst whenever `src`
      was supplied, so a hashtag conversation's page always ran the DM
      branch (computing a corrupted conversation_key) instead of matching the
      real one. Covers a plain hashtag dst, a via-routed hashtag dst param,
      and `get_search_summary`'s destinations list (which used to GLOB-filter
      on digits only, making every hashtag conversation invisible to search).
  (g) `store_telemetry()` qnh storage (2026-09-11 decision: firmware item 174
      gave the barometric QNH reference a plausibility gate and re-latch, so
      MCProxy stores `qnh` again instead of dropping it) — a plausible BLE
      qnh persists to both `telemetry.qnh` and `station_positions.qnh`; a
      wrong-unit UDP `tele` qnh (mmHg junk, e.g. 760) is rejected by
      `_QNH_PLAUSIBLE_HPA_RANGE` and stores NULL without deriving a qfe from
      it; and a later frame with no qnh at all leaves NULL in its OWN
      `telemetry` row (an honest INSERT once outside the dedup window) while
      `station_positions.qnh` keeps the last real value via its
      `COALESCE(excluded.qnh, station_positions.qnh)` upsert clause.

All timestamps are MILLISECONDS (project-wide DB convention).
