# and ceiling only; it plays NO role in telling a real pressure from the `lora`-variant

# store_telemetry — verdict V4/V4a: magnitude cannot do that job in either direction,
# because an altitude above 850 m passes a >850 floor and a genuine high-altitude QFE
# fails it). Bounds: recorded sea-level pressure extremes run ~870-1085 hPa (deepest
# cyclone to strongest anticyclone); station-level QFE drops further before any
# sea-level correction, and this mesh already has stations as high as ~1750 m
# (DO9ALM-5, true QFE ~820 hPa; DB0HOB-12 1543 m, ~841 hPa) that a tighter floor would
# discard. 300 hPa corresponds to roughly 9000 m — no station on this network is

# is stored, unvalidated, straight into `node_press_asl` (`extudp_functions.cpp:180-183`)
# and reaches us on all three qnh paths. Reproduced: qnh=760 at alt=500 fabricated a

        `signal_via` is ONLY meaningful (and only ever written) on the 'signal'
        branch: the callsign of the station whose transmission actually delivered
        the `rssi`/`snr` carried on THIS SAME call — the row's own callsign for a
        direct reception, the last hop of the relay chain otherwise. It must be
        derived fresh from the same frame that produced rssi/snr (see
        store_message/_ingest_signal) and written atomically with them; the
        'position' branch never touches this column, so a stale relay path can
        never be paired with a fresh measurement (that pairing is the original bug
        this column exists to fix).

        `.get("timestamp")` with a fallback is NOT enough: a frame carrying an explicit
        `"timestamp": null` returns None, not the default. Combined with SQLite's scalar
        MAX() — which yields NULL if ANY argument is NULL — one such frame used to pin
        that callsign's `last_seen` to NULL forever, so it rendered as epoch 1970 on the
        map (query.py's `row["last_seen"] or 0`) and became immune to pruning (which
        guards `last_seen IS NOT NULL`). A literal 0 is preserved: ble_protocol's
        unparseable-node-clock fallback deliberately produces epoch 0.

        The MeshCom firmware hand-escapes a backslash in `sendExtern()`'s JSON
        builder (`extudp_functions.cpp:379/385`) and then hands the already-escaped
        string to ArduinoJson, which escapes it a second time. Every position beacon
        using the *alternate* APRS symbol table therefore arrives on Extern-UDP :1799
        with a two-character `\\\\` where the one-character `\\` (0x5C) is meant, and
        MCProxy stored that verbatim: the frontend cannot resolve the symbol and
        renders a grey placeholder instead of the icon. The BLE path is unaffected —
        `parse_aprs_position` decodes raw APRS text and its `([/\\\\])` group captures
        exactly one character. Full evidence: `aprs-escape-bug.md`.

        The ingress fix in `udp_handler.py` only cleans *new* traffic, so this repairs
        the rows already on disk, in both places the value lives:

        * `station_positions.aprs_symbol_group` / `.aprs_symbol` — **required**. This
          is what `storage/query.py` reads to build the position payload, i.e. the
          table that decides whether the icon appears at all.
        * `messages.raw_json` — not read for normal display, but the v2 migration in
          `storage/migrations.py` rebuilds `station_positions` from
          `json_extract(raw_json, '$.aprs_symbol_group')`. Leaving history dirty means
          that migration resurrects the bug if it ever re-runs.

        Both symbol fields are single characters by APRS definition, so a value of
        exactly two backslashes is unambiguously the firmware's double-escape and never
        a legitimate symbol. Every predicate below is an exact equality against that
        two-character value, bound as a parameter — never a substring replace, which
        would mangle a message body that legitimately contains two backslashes, and
        never an interpolated literal, where one backslash too few or too many is
        invisible in review.

        Guarded by an `aprs_escape_backfill_done:v1` marker in the shared meta table
        (same shape as `backfill_signal_log`). Idempotent regardless of the marker:
        after the first pass the two-character value no longer exists, so every
        predicate matches zero rows and a second run is a no-op. A single-character
        `\\` is never touched, in either direction.

        The `messages` scan is unindexed (`json_extract` in the WHERE clause) and runs
        off the startup critical path — see `_maybe_backfill_aprs_symbol_escapes`.

        # only lat/lon/alt/batt — while the BLE copy carries the full APRS string with
        # its `/P=` station pressure. UDP is the faster path, so it lands first and the
        # BLE copy hits this gate; returning outright dropped the ONLY carrier of `/P=`
        # in the system. (The `lora`-variant `tele` datagram that rides along with the
        # UDP `pos` cannot substitute: its `qfe` key is fed from the firmware's `/F=`
        # field — a barometric ALTITUDE IN METRES, not a pressure at any magnitude — so
        # `store_telemetry` discards it by `src_type == "lora"`, not by size, and the
        # document has no `press` key at all. `extudp_functions.cpp:470-480`. The
        # `node`-variant tele, by contrast, DOES carry a real hPa in `qfe`
        # (`node_press`, `extudp_functions.cpp:459`) — see verdict V4/V4a.)
