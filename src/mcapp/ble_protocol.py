    Returns None when `message` is not an APRS position at all. That None is
    expensive: `transform_pos` turns it into `{}`, so the emitted pos frame has
    no lat/lon/symbol whatsoever, and `_store_position`'s `if lat and lon` gate
    then writes nothing — the station silently drops off the map. The position
    exists ONLY in this ASCII payload (the binary `@!` footer carries hw/mod/
    fcs/fw, never coordinates), so a None here has no rescue path downstream.
    Hence the regex must accept everything the firmware is willing to transmit,
    no more and no less (see the table-id note below).

    Symbol fields:

    * `aprs_symbol_group` — the symbol *table id*. Always present whenever this
      function returns a dict, because the regex requires it.
    * `aprs_symbol` — the symbol *code*. The key is **omitted entirely** when
      the frame carries no code, rather than defaulted to a placeholder.
      `"?"` (the previous fallback) is not a safe stand-in: it is itself a valid
      APRS symbol code (info kiosk / file server), so "we don't know" was being
      published as a confident, specific, wrong answer — and, because
      `_store_position`'s UPSERT keeps the stored symbol only while the incoming
      one is NULL or '', that synthesised `?` also overwrote a symbol the
      station had previously reported correctly.

      Omission is how every other optional field here already signals absence
      (`alt`, `batt`, `group_N`, the weather fields, `extras`), and it is the
      only representation that stays absent the whole way down: the key never
      enters the SSE frame, `_store_position` binds SQL NULL via
      `data.get("aprs_symbol")`, the UPSERT's `IS NOT NULL AND != ''` guard
      therefore PRESERVES the station's earlier symbol, and `query.py`'s
      truthiness guard leaves the field out of the read payload. An empty
      string would behave identically in SQL but is merely falsy-but-present on
      the wire — consumers would receive `"aprs_symbol": ""` and have to
      special-case it. The webapp is being moved to treat a missing symbol
      field as genuinely absent, so absence is now the well-handled signal.

      To be explicit about the risk this trades against: a pin can only lose
      its glyph when the station never supplied a real code in the first place.
      A code that WAS reported is still parsed and still stored, and a frame
      without one no longer clobbers it, so nothing that used to render a real
      symbol starts rendering nothing.

    DATE TIME PLT HW MOD RSSI SNR DIST PL MESH NCNT`
    (`mheard_functions.cpp:400-414`) — none of `SRC`/`GW`/`PP` among them; the
    `--mheard` table dump (`mheard_functions.cpp:651`) never sent any of the
    three either, reconstructing from a stored `|`-separated string that
    never held them.

    The parsing below is DELIBERATELY RETAINED, not dead code: every access
    is `.get()` and every coercer (`_coerce_mh_origin`, `_coerce_gw`,
    `parse_hey_chain`) is `None`-safe, so a firmware build that re-adds the
    fields is picked up here with no code change. Against the current
    firmware `mh_origin` is always `None`, `gw` is always `None`, and
    `hey_chain`/`hey_chain_raw` are always `None` — which means the
    `hey_path` parser, the `"heard"` upsert keyed on `mh_origin`, and every
    BLE-path write to `station_positions.gw` are INERT against this
    firmware, not merely quiet.

    `CALL` is the LAST HOP: the station whose transmission this frame's own
    `RSSI`/`SNR` actually measured, and it stays keyed to `src` exactly as
    before (migration v22 exists because that attribution was once wrong —
    do not rekey it). This is unaffected by the revert. Were `SRC`/`GW` to
    return: `SRC` is the ORIGINATING station, owning identity (`mh_origin`)
    and, on a HEY frame only, gateway status (`gw`, derived from the
    destination path the originator sets and relays never modify). `GW`
    would be `0` on every non-HEY payload because the destination path is
    something else entirely, so `gw` is emitted only when `PLT ==
    _MH_PAYLOAD_TYPE_HEY` (`0x40`) — otherwise `None`, fail-closed, rather
    than asserting a claim the frame never made. `mh_origin` stays ungated:
    `SRC` was set unconditionally on every frame type
    (`mheard_functions.cpp:350`, before the revert). On a typical site
    roughly two thirds of HEY observations were relayed, so `SRC != CALL`
    was the common case, and `gw` describes `SRC`, never `CALL` —
    attributing it to `CALL` would be wrong for every relayed beacon.

    `PP` carried a hop-by-hop signal-report chain while it existed; its
    absence carried no information even then, because the register dropped
    `PP` (then `DIST`) whenever the JSON would exceed 244 chars — starting at
    roughly 5 relay hops, precisely the deep chains where it would have been
    most interesting. Against the current, fully-reverted firmware `PP` is
    simply never sent at all, full stop; a missing `hey_chain` says nothing
    about hop count either way.

    `NCNT` and `DIST` each carry a firmware sentinel that this transformer
    normalises to `None` at this wire boundary (`_coerce_mh_ncnt`,
    `_coerce_mh_dist`) — `0` and any negative value respectively are "not
    set", not real measurements. The chain's own `origin_ncnt`/`hops[].ncnt`
    are unaffected: those are fresh transmit-time values, and a `0` there is
    real. Both `NCNT`/`DIST` and this sentinel handling are independent of
    the `SRC`/`GW`/`PP` revert and stay live today.
