        Deliberately has no CONNECTING-state/cooldown guard like `connect()`:
        ble_service's own `is_busy` check already answers synchronously
        (surfaced here as a 409 -> "busy"), and a cooldown would block the
        exact case `pin_required` exists to serve -- the user immediately
        retrying with the correct PIN.

        The mcapp<->ble_service SSE stream is a plain HTTP stream between two
        local processes, and it goes down for entirely mundane reasons: a
        ble_service restart, a deploy, a momentary network hiccup. When it
        stays down past SSE_DISCONNECT_GRACE_S the loop above publishes
        `("disconnect BLE", "lost")`, which mcapp's
        `_clear_ble_cache_on_disconnect` treats as a real disconnect and wipes
        `cached_ble_registers` — while the RADIO link between ble_service and
        the node is, in this exact scenario, usually still perfectly alive.

        Nothing refilled that cache. The node only re-sends its config burst
        after a genuine hello handshake, and no hello happens when an HTTP
        stream reconnects, so every SSE blip used to permanently degrade the
        frontend to placeholder values until the user manually reconnected.
        This closes that loop: one explicit register sweep, scheduled on the
        router, using no-burst delay semantics because there was no hello to
        wait out — specifically `replay_grace=True` rather than the plain
        quiet delay, because this call and `_replay_cached_registers` right
        below it in `_sse_loop` race each other on every SSE (re)connect: both
        fire in the same breath, and the replay usually lands the whole
        register cache in ~1-1.5 s with zero RF. The grace delay gives that
        replay comfortable headroom to finish before `skip_if_complete=True`
        checks completeness, so a recovery the replay already fully repaired
        does not also pay a redundant ~9 s, 10-command sweep; a replay that
        404s (older ble_service) or lands short still gets the full sweep.

        Fires only when this client is the one that published the loss (the
        `_sse_lost_published` latch), so a first-ever stream connect at startup
        does not trigger it — `build_app()`'s `requery_reused_ble_connection`
        already owns that case, and the router's single-flight guard would drop
        the duplicate anyway.

        Deliberately does NOT probe the link itself. The local status still
        says DISCONNECTED here (the grace-period handler set it), so any check
        this method could make would be against exactly the stale value the
        sweep exists to correct; the sweep re-checks with a real
        `refresh_status()` round trip once it starts, which also restores
        `self._status` to CONNECTED, and it no-ops if the radio really did go
        away. Reached through `getattr` rather than an import to keep this
        module free of a `main` import — that direction is a cycle, since
        `main` imports the BLE client factory that imports this module. The
        two new keyword args are plain bools for the same reason: no delay
        constant or enum needs to cross the module boundary, just intent.
