# brace plus the sender's message counter, formatted `%03i` -- so `{087`, with
# NO closing brace. There is no `{NNN}` form on the wire and there never will
# be (assuming one caused a real bug once); a trailing `{NNN}` is ordinary chat
# text. Group and broadcast sends never carry the suffix at all.
#
# `[0-9]`, never `\d`: Python's `\d` matches every Unicode Nd digit (Arabic-Indic
# ٠-٩ and friends), which the firmware cannot emit. The same choice is already
# made for the `:ackNNN` patterns in commands/ctcping.py and in linkcheck.py.
#
# TWO widths, deliberately, because the call sites want different things:
#
#   ACK_SUFFIX_RE        one-or-more digits. The lenient reader used wherever we
#                        only want the suffix GONE (command routing, push payload
#                        text). Being lenient costs nothing there.
#   ACK_SUFFIX_FIXED_RE  exactly three, the firmware's literal `%03i` width, and
#                        capturing. Used where the digits are DATA rather than
#                        noise -- ctcping's echo correlation reads the id back

#                        variable-width match would change what it extracts.
#
# Keep both here rather than inline at the call sites: before this module owned
# them there were four separate literals across parsing.py, ctcping.py (x2) and
# push_delivery.py, three of which still spelled `\d` after the strict-pattern

# --- APRS symbol double-escape (firmware bug) ------------------------------

# ArduinoJson, which escapes it a second time. Every position beacon using the
# *alternate* APRS symbol table therefore arrives on Extern-UDP :1799 with two
# characters where the one-character table id (0x5C) is meant, so the frontend
# cannot resolve the symbol and renders a grey placeholder. The BLE path is
# unaffected — `parse_aprs_position` decodes raw APRS text and its `([/\\])`
# group captures exactly one character. Full evidence: `aprs-escape-bug.md`.
#
# Written as escaped Python literals on purpose: a raw literal would make the
# one-vs-two character distinction this whole normalization turns on impossible
# to see. `FIRMWARE_DOUBLED_BACKSLASH` is TWO 0x5C characters (what the firmware
# sends), `APRS_ALTERNATE_TABLE` is ONE (the APRS alternate symbol table id).
#
# These live here, next to the single normalizer below, because the value is
# needed in two unrelated places — the UDP ingress that cleans NEW traffic
# (`udp_handler`) and the one-time backfill that repairs rows already on disk
# (`storage/ingest.backfill_aprs_symbol_escapes`, which binds them as SQL
# parameters). They were duplicated per module until one drifting copy was

    Deliberately an exact match on the two-character value, not a

    A left-to-right scan, NOT `str.replace("\\\\\\"", "\\"")`. `strEsc` inserts one
