"""Regression + round-trip guards for the Wave 1 node-identity pairing-drift
fix (2026-07-30).

The bug: pairing a DIFFERENT node to the Pi (e.g. swapping DK5EN-14 for
DK5EN-98) used to leave the proxy silently believing it was still the OLD
callsign. `/etc/mcapp/config.json` is written once by the bash installer and
never again from Python, and `cfg.call_sign` was read into TWO independent,
never-resynchronised copies (`MessageRouter.my_callsign` and
`CommandHandler.my_callsign`/`admin_callsign_base`) — silently breaking
suppression, self-DM detection, command routing, and Web Push eligibility.

Covers, end to end and fully offline:
  - `runtime_state.py`'s persisted overlay: round-trip, atomic-write/file-mode,
    and "never raise" on missing/corrupt/non-dict/unwritable content.
  - `Config.load` layering that overlay on top of config.json so overlay keys
    win, while an empty/missing overlay stays a complete no-op.
  - `MessageRouter.apply_callsign` fanning a callsign change out to BOTH
    identity holders, preserving an operator-authored `user_info_text` while
    regenerating a still-default one, and being a true no-op (returns False,
    no churn) when the callsign hasn't actually changed.
  - The real `_wire_ble_caches` subscriber that detects the node's own
    callsign from its BLE "I" register (auto-sent on every connect) and
    drives `apply_callsign` — including that its persist step runs off the
    asyncio thread and is serialised against a concurrent second frame.
  - `build_app`'s actual wiring ORDER (set_callsign runs before the command
    handler exists), and `GET /api/status`'s new `call_sign` field.

Never touches the real `/var/lib/mcapp`: every `runtime_state` call here uses
the injectable `path=` seam into a `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()`, and
`save_runtime_state` is monkeypatched (never runs for real) wherever it would
otherwise execute through `config_loader`'s or `main`'s module-level default.
