"""Web Push delivery internals (Wave 5, PWA campaign): the pure matcher and
payload builder, the per-subscription coalescing state machine, VAPID
keypair persistence, and the background dispatcher that performs the actual
pywebpush delivery in isolation from the mesh-message ingest path.

See `src/mcapp/contract/push_contract.json` (byte-verbatim copy of the wire
contract also implemented by the mc-chat sibling) for match/coalesce/prune
semantics; `push_tests.py` runs every vector in it against this module.

Execution isolation (contract `execution_isolation`): `PushDispatcher.handle_mesh_message`
is the coroutine subscribed to `MessageRouter`'s "mesh_message" topic (wired in
`sse_routes/push.py`). It performs ONE local SQLite read (fast, not the network
call this isolation protects against) plus pure in-memory matching/coalescing,
and never awaits push delivery itself — it only enqueues. `_drain_loop` (a
background task) is the sole place that calls the injectable `webpush_fn`, via
`asyncio.to_thread` with explicit connect/read timeouts, so a no-internet Pi
Zero 2W cannot stall the event loop or SSE heartbeats on an unreachable push
service.

Testability seams (contract): `now()` is an injectable clock (never real
wall-clock in tests) and `webpush_fn` is an injectable callable (never real
pywebpush in tests). `generate_vapid_keypair` is the only function that
performs real EC keygen; tests inject a fake generator into
`load_or_create_vapid` instead of calling it.
