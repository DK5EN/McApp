"""Startup regression suite for the shared message-dedup contract (v2).

Implements every vector in `contract/dedup_contract.json` (a byte-verbatim
copy of the shared contract; the mc-chat sibling implements the SAME vectors
against its own `PushService._is_duplicate`, and the webapp implements them
against its own store, so all three behave identically on window duration
and key-derivation precedence) — replays every `key_vectors` entry through
the REAL `PushDedup` key derivation and every `window_vectors` entry through
the REAL duplicate check, plus asserts `DEDUP_WINDOW_MS`/`DEDUP_WINDOW_SECONDS`
agree with the contract's `window_ms`.

`contract/dedup_contract.json` is subtree-managed, with mc-chat upstream —
edit it there and re-sync (CLAUDE.md, "Vendored Subtrees"), never in place
here.

Read the contract's own `description` for the full scope note; in short, it
pins exactly two things: `window_ms`, and the abstract key-derivation
PRECEDENCE (msg_id-primary when truthy, else content fallback over
(src, dst, text)). It deliberately does NOT pin window-boundary/expiry
mechanics — `PushDedup` is a one-sided, call-time-keyed `OrderedDict` cache
(pruned once `now() - seen_at` exceeds the window, never refreshed on a
repeat hit), not a message-timestamp-keyed one like the webapp's, so every
`window_vectors` entry sits a full minute clear of the boundary in either
direction, and this divergence never matters here. It also does NOT pin the
storage layer's separate `msg_id`+`src` SQL dedup (`sqlite_storage.py`) —
this suite exercises only `PushDedup`, the push-delivery layer's guard.

v2 (2026-09-27, firmware PN-retry XOR): a truthy msg_id now keys as
(resolved-src, core(msg_id)) rather than the raw msg_id — see the contract's
`key_semantics`. Some `window_vectors` entries carry an optional `msg_id_b`:
the id the SECOND call in that vector uses instead of replaying the first
message's own `msg_id` (the firmware retry itself changes the id, so a
harness that always replays the first msg_id would never actually exercise a
retry pair, and every such vector would pass vacuously regardless of whether
`PushDedup` masks bits 10-11 at all).
