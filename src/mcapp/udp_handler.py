    a scalar used to travel all the way down into `store_message`. Measured on a
    lora `pos` frame with one field replaced by `{}`, the damage varies by field
    and none of it is a clean rejection:

    * `firmware` / `fw_sub` / `batt` — the WORST case. `_ingest_signal` completes
      and COMMITs, then `_store_position`'s upsert dies on the bind, so the station
      row survives HALF-POPULATED (rssi/snr/last_seen present, no coordinates, no
      symbol) — worse than never having stored it.
    * `hw_id` — dies inside `_ingest_signal` itself, after its `signal_log` INSERT:
      an orphaned signal row, no station row.
    * `msg_id` — dies on the dedup SELECT's bind, before any write.
    * `rssi` / `snr` — `TypeError` from the range comparison; `src` — `AttributeError`
      from `src.split`. All three are raised BEFORE SQLite is reached, which is why
      widening a `try/except sqlite3.Error` around the DB calls would have closed
      only part of this. Rejecting the shape at the one ingress that can produce it
      covers every field at once.

    Severity is low and this is pre-existing (an attacker only corrupts the station
    row of the callsign in their OWN datagram, and `main.py` already prints a full
    traceback when it happens) — the point is the half-written row, not silence.

    Dropping the offending FIELD rather than the whole datagram is deliberate: a

        send (see `send_message`), so once the name stops resolving (node
        renamed/re-paired), every send fails forever with no recovery. The

        matching immediately.

        That leaves one flap the identity rule cannot decide on its own: TWO
        senders that both identify as us (duplicate callsign, or one node
        answering from two interfaces). Neither is more "right" than the
        other, so `_adopt_target` rate-limits actual address changes via

        logger.exception(...)` caught `socket.gaierror` (an OSError
        subclass) on every failed DNS lookup, so `main.py`'s `_send_via_udp`
        — which already has a try/except around this call that surfaces the
        failure to the operator via a `websocket_message` SSE error event —
        never saw it: the operator got silence and `POST /api/send` still
        answered `{"status": "ok"}`. `json.dumps` failures are left
        unguarded on purpose too: a caller passing unserializable data is a
        programming error, not a transport failure, and swallowing it here
        hid bugs the same way.

        CLIP (see `_dst_msg_wire_violation`) is a THIRD case. It MUST raise,

        ~:1465-1491) already wraps this exact call in
        `try: await udp_handler.send_message(...) except Exception as e:` and,
        on exception, both surfaces a `websocket_message` error event to the
        operator AND publishes a per-message `msg_status{send_failed: true}`
        (`_publish_send_failed`). A bare `return` produces neither: the caller
        sees nothing raised, so its except-block never runs, `POST /api/send`
        still answers `{"status": "ok"}`, and the message silently vanishes —
        exactly the black hole this guard exists to close. Every real caller
        already has this try/except; there is no bare, unguarded call site
        (checked: `commands/response.py`, `commands/ctcping.py`,
        `commands/linkcheck.py`, `commands/topic_beacon.py` all publish to the
        router's `udp_message`/`ble_message` topics rather than calling
        `send_message` directly, so they all route through this same
